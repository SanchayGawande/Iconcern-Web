If you have a blood relative with diabetes, your risk for developing it is significantly increased. Share your family health history with your doctor to find out what it may mean for you.\nRace or ethnic background: If you\u2019re of African-American, Asian-American, Latino/Hispanic-American, Native American or of Pacific-Islander descent, you have a greater chance of developing diabetes.\nAge: The older you are, the higher your risk for prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes generally occurs in middle-aged adults, most frequently after age 40. But health care professionals are diagnosing more and more children and adolescents with Type 2 diabetes.\nGestational diabetes: If you developed diabetes during pregnancy, you are at increased risk of developing diabetes again later in life.\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    Modifiable risk factors for Type 2 diabetes\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    You can \u2014 and should \u2014 do something about your modifiable risk factors. You can reduce your risk for diabetes or delay its development by making healthy changes: \n\nWeight: Being overweight or obese increases your risk of developing diabetes. Losing 5% to 10% of your body weight\u2014in addition to getting regular physical activity\u2014can significantly reduce your risk of developing diabetes. Your risk decreases even more as you lose more weight. For most people, a body mass index calculator will provide a good target weight for your height.\n\nPhysical activity: Physical inactivity is a key modifiable risk factor for prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes. Regular physical activity helps lower insulin resistance. This means your body can use its own insulin more effectively. Even a brisk 30-minute walk at least five days a week has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of diabetes and heart disease. For your overall cardiovascular health, aim for:\nAt least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity;\nOr 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity (or a combination of the two);\nAnd muscle-strengthening at least two days per week.\n\nBlood pressure: In addition to causing damage to the cardiovascular system, untreated high blood pressure has been linked to complications from diabetes. People with diabetes and HBP should maintain a blood pressure of less than 130/80 mm Hg. Normal blood pressure is below 120/80 mm Hg.\n\nCholesterol (lipid) levels: Diabetes is associated with atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) and blood vessel disease. Low HDL \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol and/or high triglycerides can increase the risk for Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Following a healthy eating plan, getting regular physical activity and reaching and maintaining a healthy weight can help improve abnormal lipid levels. Sometimes, medications are also needed.\n\nSmoking: If you smoke, there are a number of tools, medications and online resources that you can use to help you quit. Talk to your health care team about the best options for you.\n\nDiet: It\u2019s important to eat healthy foods in the right amounts. Diet is one of the most important modifiable risk factors for prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes. The American Heart Association recommends an eating plan that includes fruits and vegetables, whole grains, skinless poultry, fish, legumes, non-tropical vegetable oils and unsalted nuts and seeds. A healthy diet should also replace saturated fats with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, avoid trans fats, reduce cholesterol and sodium (salt) and limit red and processed meats, refined carbohydrates and sweetened beverages. \n\nAlcohol: Heavy use of alcohol can cause inflammation in the pancreas and limit its ability to produce enough insulin. Alcohol can cause liver damage and adds more sugar and starch to your diet that must either be used or stored as fat. Moderate your alcohol intake. That means no more than one drink per day for women or two drinks per day for men.\n\nStress and well-being: Everyone feels stress, but people react differently. Managing the stress in our lives is an important part of healthy living, not only for diabetes but for heart disease and many other conditions. Find ways to address the causes of your stress and make time for things you enjoy.\n\nSleep: Adults should get seven to nine hours of sleep a night. Sleep benefits your whole body, including your heart and brain. It improves mood, memory and reasoning. Research also has shown that too little or too much sleep is linked to a high A1C in people with Type 2 diabetes. If you have insomnia (trouble going to sleep or waking up too soon) or sleep apnea (problems breathing while asleep), work with your health care team to diagnose and treat them.\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    None\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    None\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    None\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    None\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    None\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    None\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    None\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    None\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    None\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    None\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    None\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    None\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    None\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    None\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    None\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    None\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    None\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    None\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

That means no more than one drink per day for women or two drinks per day for men.\n\nStress and well-being: Everyone feels stress, but people react differently. Managing the stress in our lives is an important part of healthy living, not only for diabetes but for heart disease and many other conditions. Find ways to address the causes of your stress and make time for things you enjoy.\n\nSleep: Adults should get seven to nine hours of sleep a night. Sleep benefits your whole body, including your heart and brain. It improves mood, memory and reasoning. Research also has shown that too little or too much sleep is linked to a high A1C in people with Type 2 diabetes. If you have insomnia (trouble going to sleep or waking up too soon) or sleep apnea (problems breathing while asleep), work with your health care team to diagnose and treat them.",

You can't control everything that can impact your health, such as your genetic makeup, age, or family history of diabetes. However, you can take steps to reach your full health potential, adding years to your life and improving its quality, even if you have been diagnosed with diabetes.\n\nLifestyle changes such as losing weight, eating healthy and engaging in regular, moderate physical activity may reduce the progression of prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes and control Type 1 diabetes. They can also minimize other risk factors such as high blood pressure, blood cholesterol and even heart attacks and strokes.\n\nIn many instances, lifestyle changes must be accompanied by medications to control blood glucose levels, high blood pressure and cholesterol. This complementary regimen may also prevent heart attack and stroke.\n\nDiabetes can be successfully managed. Work with your health care team to set personal goals. And be sure to monitor your critical health numbers, including your:\n\nBlood sugar level\nWeight\nBlood cholesterol level\nBlood pressure\n\nTaking these steps may also help prevent serious complications that can arise from diabetes.",

Prevalence has been rising more rapidly in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries.\n\nDiabetes is a major cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputation.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2019, there was a 3% increase in diabetes mortality rates by age.\n\nIn 2019, diabetes and kidney disease due to diabetes caused an estimated 2 million deaths.\n\nA healthy diet, regular physical activity, maintaining a normal body weight and avoiding tobacco use are ways to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.\n\nDiabetes can be treated and its consequences avoided or delayed with diet, physical activity, medication and regular screening and treatment for complications.\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    Overview\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose. Hyperglycaemia, also called raised blood glucose or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.\n\nIn 2014, 8.5% of adults aged 18 years and older had diabetes. In 2019, diabetes was the direct cause of 1.5 million deaths and 48% of all deaths due to diabetes occurred before the age of 70 years. Another 460 000 kidney disease deaths were caused by diabetes, and raised blood glucose causes around 20% of cardiovascular deaths (1).\n\nBetween 2000 and 2019, there was a 3% increase in age-standardized mortality rates from diabetes. In lower-middle-income countries, the mortality rate due to diabetes increased 13%.\n\nBy contrast, the probability of dying from any one of the four main noncommunicable diseases (cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases or diabetes) between the ages of 30 and 70 decreased by 22% globally between 2000 and 2019.\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    Symptoms\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    Symptoms of diabetes may occur suddenly. In type 2 diabetes, the symptoms can be mild and may take many years to be noticed.\n\nSymptoms of diabetes include:\n\nfeeling very thirsty\nneeding to urinate more often than usual\nblurred vision\nfeeling tired\nlosing weight unintentionally\nOver time, diabetes can damage blood vessels in the heart, eyes, kidneys and nerves.\n\nPeople with diabetes have a higher risk of health problems including heart attack, stroke and kidney failure.\n\nDiabetes can cause permanent vision loss by damaging blood vessels in the eyes.\n\nMany people with diabetes develop problems with their feet from nerve damage and poor blood flow. This can cause foot ulcers and may lead to amputation.\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    Type 1 diabetes\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    Type 1 diabetes (previously known as insulin-dependent, juvenile or childhood-onset) is characterized by deficient insulin production and requires daily administration of insulin. In 2017 there were 9 million people with type 1 diabetes; the majority of them live in high-income countries. Neither its cause nor the means to prevent it are known.\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    Type 2 diabetes\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    Type 2 diabetes affects how your body uses sugar (glucose) for energy. It stops the body from using insulin properly, which can lead to high levels of blood sugar if not treated.\n\nOver time, type 2 diabetes can cause serious damage to the body, especially nerves and blood vessels.\n\nType 2 diabetes is often preventable. Factors that contribute to developing type 2 diabetes include being overweight, not getting enough exercise, and genetics.\n\nEarly diagnosis is important to prevent the worst effects of type 2 diabetes. The best way to detect diabetes early is to get regular check-ups and blood tests with a healthcare provider.\n\nSymptoms of type 2 diabetes can be mild. They may take several years to be noticed.  Symptoms may be similar to those of type 1 diabetes but are often less marked. As a result, the disease may be diagnosed several years after onset, after complications have already arisen.\n\nMore than 95% of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes was formerly called non-insulin dependent, or adult onset. Until recently, this type of diabetes was seen only in adults but it is now also occurring increasingly frequently in children.\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    Gestational diabetes\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    Gestational diabetes is hyperglycaemia with blood glucose values above normal but below those diagnostic of diabetes. Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy.\n\nWomen with gestational diabetes are at an increased risk of complications during pregnancy and at delivery. These women and possibly their children are also at increased risk of type 2 diabetes in the future.\n\nGestational diabetes is diagnosed through prenatal screening, rather than through reported symptoms.\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    Impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glycaemia\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG) are intermediate conditions in the transition between normality and diabetes. People with IGT or IFG are at high risk of progressing to type 2 diabetes, although this is not inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    Prevention\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    Lifestyle changes are the best way to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.\n\nTo help prevent type 2 diabetes and its complications, people should:\n\nreach and keep a health body weight\nstay physically active with at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise each day\neat a healthy diet and avoid sugar and saturated fat\nnot smoke tobacco.\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    Diagnosis and treatment\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    Early diagnosis can be accomplished through relatively inexpensive testing of blood glucose. People with type 1 diabetes need insulin injections for survival.\n\nOne of the most important ways to treat diabetes is to keep a healthy lifestyle.\n\nSome people with type 2 diabetes will need to take medicines to help manage their blood sugar levels. These can include insulin injections or other medicines. Some examples include:\n\nmetformin\nsulfonylureas\nsodium-glucose co-transporters type 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors.\nAlong with medicines to lower blood sugar, people with diabetes often need medications to lower their blood pressure and statins to reduce the risk of complications.\n\nAdditional medical care may be needed to treat the effects of diabetes:\n\nfoot care to treat ulcers\nscreening and treatment for kidney disease\neye exams to screen for retinopathy (which causes blindness).\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    WHO response\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    WHO aims to stimulate and support the adoption of effective measures for the surveillance, prevention and control of diabetes and its complications, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.

      "description":"Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy.\n\nYour body breaks down most of the food you eat into sugar (glucose) and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your body\u2019s cells for use as energy.\n\nWith diabetes, your body doesn\u2019t make enough insulin or can\u2019t use it as well as it should. When there isn\u2019t enough insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much blood sugar stays in your bloodstream. Over time, that can cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease.\n\nThere isn\u2019t a cure yet for diabetes, but losing weight, eating healthy food, and being active can really help. Other things you can do to help:\n\nTake medicine as prescribed.\nGet diabetes self-management education and support.\nMake and keep health care appointments.",

Being overweight and inactive are key contributing factors.\n   </p>\n   <div id=\"LSQ\">\n    <h2>\n     How insulin works\n    </h2>\n    <p>\n     Insulin is a hormone that comes from the pancreas \u2014 a gland located behind and below the stomach. Insulin controls how the body uses sugar in the following ways:\n\nSugar in the bloodstream triggers the pancreas to release insulin.\nInsulin circulates in the bloodstream, enabling sugar to enter the cells.\nThe amount of sugar in the bloodstream drops.\nIn response to this drop, the pancreas releases less insulin.\n    </p>\n   </div>\n   <div id=\"SXM\">\n    <h3>\n     The role of glucose\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n     Glucose \u2014 a sugar \u2014 is a main source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. The use and regulation of glucose includes the following:\n\nGlucose comes from two major sources: food and the liver.\nGlucose is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin.\nThe liver stores and makes glucose.\nWhen glucose levels are low, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep the body's glucose level within a healthy range.\nIn type 2 diabetes, this process doesn't work well. Instead of moving into the cells, sugar builds up in the blood. As blood sugar levels rise, the pancreas releases more insulin. Eventually the cells in the pancreas that make insulin become damaged and can't make enough insulin to meet the body's needs.\n    </p>\n   </div>\n   <div id=\"WRF\">\n    <h3>\n     Risk factors\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n     Factors that may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes include:\n\nWeight. Being overweight or obese is a main risk.\nFat distribution. Storing fat mainly in the abdomen \u2014 rather than the hips and thighs \u2014 indicates a greater risk. The risk of type 2 diabetes is higher in men with a waist circumference above 40 inches (101.6 centimeters) and in women with a waist measurement above 35 inches (88.9 centimeters).\nInactivity. The less active a person is, the greater the risk. Physical activity helps control weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes cells more sensitive to insulin.\nFamily history. An individual's risk of type 2 diabetes increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes.\nRace and ethnicity. Although it's unclear why, people of certain races and ethnicities \u2014 including Black, Hispanic, Native American and Asian people, and Pacific Islanders \u2014 are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than white people are.\nBlood lipid levels. An increased risk is associated with low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol \u2014 the \"good\" cholesterol \u2014 and high levels of triglycerides.\nAge. The risk of type 2 diabetes increases with age, especially after age 35.\nPrediabetes. Prediabetes is a condition in which the blood sugar level is higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. Left untreated, prediabetes often progresses to type 2 diabetes.\nPregnancy-related risks. The risk of developing type 2 diabetes is higher in people who had gestational diabetes when they were pregnant and in those who gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds (4 kilograms).\nPolycystic ovary syndrome. Having polycystic ovary syndrome \u2014 a condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity \u2014 increases the risk of diabetes.\n    </p>\n   </div>\n   <div id=\"USR\">\n    <h3>\n     Complications\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n     Healthy lifestyle choices can help prevent type 2 diabetes. If you've received a diagnosis of prediabetes, lifestyle changes may slow or stop the progression to diabetes.\n\nA healthy lifestyle includes:\n\nEating healthy foods. Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains.\nGetting active. Aim for 150 or more minutes a week of moderate to vigorous aerobic activity, such as a brisk walk, bicycling, running or swimming.\nLosing weight. If you are overweight, losing a modest amount of weight and keeping it off may delay the progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes. If you have prediabetes, losing 7% to 10% of your body weight may reduce the risk of diabetes.\nAvoiding long stretches of inactivity. Sitting still for long periods of time can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. Try to get up every 30 minutes and move around for at least a few minutes.\nFor people with prediabetes, metformin (Fortamet, Glumetza, others), a diabetes medication, may be prescribed to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. This is usually prescribed for older adults who are obese and unable to lower blood sugar levels with lifestyle changes.\n    </p>\n   </div>\n  </main>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

      "description":"Type 2 diabetes is a condition that happens because of a problem in the way the body regulates and uses sugar as a fuel. That sugar also is called glucose. This long-term condition results in too much sugar circulating in the blood. Eventually, high blood sugar levels can lead to disorders of the circulatory, nervous and immune systems.\n\nIn type 2 diabetes, there are primarily two problems. The pancreas does not produce enough insulin \u2014 a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into the cells. And cells respond poorly to insulin and take in less sugar.\n\nType 2 diabetes used to be known as adult-onset diabetes, but both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can begin during childhood and adulthood. Type 2 is more common in older adults. But the increase in the number of children with obesity has led to more cases of type 2 diabetes in younger people.\n\nThere's no cure for type 2 diabetes. Losing weight, eating well and exercising can help manage the disease. If diet and exercise aren't enough to control blood sugar, diabetes medications or insulin therapy may be recommended.",

The use and regulation of glucose includes the following:\n\nGlucose comes from two major sources: food and the liver.\nGlucose is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin.\nThe liver stores and makes glucose.\nWhen glucose levels are low, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep the body's glucose level within a healthy range.\nIn type 2 diabetes, this process doesn't work well. Instead of moving into the cells, sugar builds up in the blood. As blood sugar levels rise, the pancreas releases more insulin. Eventually the cells in the pancreas that make insulin become damaged and can't make enough insulin to meet the body's needs.",
      "sub_heading_3":"Risk factors",
      "sub_heading_3_description":"Factors that may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes include:\n\nWeight. Being overweight or obese is a main risk.\nFat distribution. Storing fat mainly in the abdomen \u2014 rather than the hips and thighs \u2014 indicates a greater risk. The risk of type 2 diabetes is higher in men with a waist circumference above 40 inches (101.6 centimeters) and in women with a waist measurement above 35 inches (88.9 centimeters).\nInactivity. The less active a person is, the greater the risk. Physical activity helps control weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes cells more sensitive to insulin.\nFamily history. An individual's risk of type 2 diabetes increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes.\nRace and ethnicity. Although it's unclear why, people of certain races and ethnicities \u2014 including Black, Hispanic, Native American and Asian people, and Pacific Islanders \u2014 are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than white people are.\nBlood lipid levels. An increased risk is associated with low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol \u2014 the \"good\" cholesterol \u2014 and high levels of triglycerides.\nAge. The risk of type 2 diabetes increases with age, especially after age 35.\nPrediabetes. Prediabetes is a condition in which the blood sugar level is higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. Left untreated, prediabetes often progresses to type 2 diabetes.\nPregnancy-related risks. The risk of developing type 2 diabetes is higher in people who had gestational diabetes when they were pregnant and in those who gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds (4 kilograms).\nPolycystic ovary syndrome. Having polycystic ovary syndrome \u2014 a condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity \u2014 increases the risk of diabetes.",
      "sub_heading_4":"Complications",
      "sub_heading_4_description":"Type 2 diabetes affects many major organs, including the heart, blood vessels, nerves, eyes and kidneys. Also, factors that increase the risk of diabetes are risk factors for other serious diseases. Managing diabetes and controlling blood sugar can lower the risk for these complications and other medical conditions, including:\n\nHeart and blood vessel disease. Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure and narrowing of blood vessels, a condition called atherosclerosis.\nNerve damage in limbs. This condition is called neuropathy. High blood sugar over time can damage or destroy nerves. That may result in tingling, numbness, burning, pain or eventual loss of feeling that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward.\nOther nerve damage. Damage to nerves of the heart can contribute to irregular heart rhythms. Nerve damage in the digestive system can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. Nerve damage also may cause erectile dysfunction.\nKidney disease. Diabetes may lead to chronic kidney disease or end-stage kidney disease that can't be reversed. That may require dialysis or a kidney transplant.\nEye damage. Diabetes increases the risk of serious eye diseases, such as cataracts and glaucoma, and may damage the blood vessels of the retina, potentially leading to blindness.\nSkin conditions. Diabetes may raise the risk of some skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections.\nSlow healing. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can become serious infections, which may heal poorly. Severe damage might require toe, foot or leg amputation.\nHearing impairment. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes.\nSleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea is common in people living with type 2 diabetes. Obesity may be the main contributing factor to both conditions.\nDementia. Type 2 diabetes seems to increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other disorders that cause dementia. Poor control of blood sugar is linked to a more rapid decline in memory and other thinking skills.",

When symptoms are present, they may include:\n\nIncreased thirst.\nFrequent urination.\nIncreased hunger.\nUnintended weight loss.\nFatigue.\nBlurred vision.\nSlow-healing sores.\nFrequent infections.\nNumbness or tingling in the hands or feet.\nAreas of darkened skin, usually in the armpits and neck.",

Being overweight and inactive are key contributing factors.",
      "sub_topic_4":"Prevention",
      "sub_topic_4_description":"Healthy lifestyle choices can help prevent type 2 diabetes. If you've received a diagnosis of prediabetes, lifestyle changes may slow or stop the progression to diabetes.\n\nA healthy lifestyle includes:\n\nEating healthy foods. Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains.\nGetting active. Aim for 150 or more minutes a week of moderate to vigorous aerobic activity, such as a brisk walk, bicycling, running or swimming.\nLosing weight. If you are overweight, losing a modest amount of weight and keeping it off may delay the progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes. If you have prediabetes, losing 7% to 10% of your body weight may reduce the risk of diabetes.\nAvoiding long stretches of inactivity. Sitting still for long periods of time can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. Try to get up every 30 minutes and move around for at least a few minutes.\nFor people with prediabetes, metformin (Fortamet, Glumetza, others), a diabetes medication, may be prescribed to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. This is usually prescribed for older adults who are obese and unable to lower blood sugar levels with lifestyle changes.",

Learn how to stay heart healthy to reduce your risk.\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    Of diabetes complications, this is one you want to pay close attention to.\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    Cardiovascular disease (CVD), where the heart and blood vessels are negatively impacted, is the number one cause of death in people living with diabetes, resulting in 2/3 of deaths in people with type 2 diabetes. And on top of that, people with diabetes are twice as likely to have heart disease or a stroke than people without diabetes. \n\nHowever, there is good news. With proper exercise, diet, and diabetes management, you can reduce your risk of getting CVD and the complications that come with it.\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    What are the different types of CVD?\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    Atherosclerosis\n\nWhen you\u2019re in good health, blood vessels are free of restrictions and allow blood pumped from the heart to travel everywhere in your body. And with the blood, oxygen and nutrients flow, too.\n\nThings start to get dicey when blood does not flow properly. In the case of atherosclerosis, blood vessels stiffen and become narrow due to fatty plaque build-up. This lack of blood-flow can leave your heart without enough oxygen, causing coronary heart disease. \n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t just affect your heart, it can cause problems in any blood vessel in your body. If it happens to the vessels in your legs, it can cause peripheral artery disease, and if in the brain\u2014stroke. \n\nRisk Factors:\n\nDiabetes\nHigh blood pressure\nHigh LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglycerides\nLow HDL (good) cholesterol\nToo little physical activity\nSmoking\nBeing overweight or obese \n\n\nHeart Failure\n\nThis form of CVD occurs when the muscles in the heart become too weak to pump blood properly and your heart becomes unable to supply enough blood to all parts of your body. \n\nRisk Factors:\n\nDiabetes\nCoronary heart disease\nHigh blood pressure \n\n\nArrhythmias\n\nAn irregular heartbeat is caused when structural changes or damage to the heart disrupt the electrical messages that keep the heart beating. At its worst, arrhythmias can cause death via cardiac arrest, through loss of blood flow to the heart.\n   </p>\n   <div id=\"DWI\">\n    <h2>\n     Watch out for the symptoms of CVD.\n    </h2>\n    <p>\n     Shortness of breath\nFatigue \nPain in your: chest (angina), throat, back, legs, neck, jaw, upper abdomen, arms.\nWeakness or numbness in your arms or legs\n    </p>\n   </div>\n   <div id=\"LLE\">\n    <h3>\n     Take emergency action.\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n     If you feel any of the following symptoms, call 911 immediately to prevent further damage to your heart, brain, and blood vessels.\n\nHeart Attack:\nChest pain or discomfort, tightness, pressure\nFullness\u2014this might feel like indigestion or heartburn\nDiscomfort in one or both of your arms, back, jaw, neck, or upper abdomen\nShortness of breath\nSweating\nIndigestion, nausea, or vomiting \nTiredness, fainting, or light-headedness\n\nHeart Failure:\nShortness of breath\nWeakness\nNausea\nQuick or irregular heartbeat\nCoughing with pink-tinged mucus\nFatigue\nSwelling of the feet and ankles (from fluid retention)\n    </p>\n   </div>\n   <div id=\"GDY\">\n    <h3>\n     Stay on top of your heart health.\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n     The best way to maintain your heart health is to manage your diabetes.

Diet, exercise, taking your insulin and medication as prescribed, attending your doctor visits, and seeking support from medical professionals, family, and friends will all help you get there. \n\nIn the meantime, it\u2019s best to frequently check your A1C, LDL, and blood pressure. \n\nAt every office visit:\nCheck your blood pressure\nTalk about your blood glucose meter readings. Take along your meter/logbook\nCheck your weight and talk about ways to reach a healthy weight\nTalk about what you eat\nDiscuss any lifestyle, work, or emotional changes\nDiscuss your physical activity\nIf you smoke, talk about ways to quit\nRemove shoes and socks to have your feet checked\nTalk about all the medicine you take, including over-the-counter pills, herbs, vitamins, and other supplements\nAsk if you should take aspirin to lower your chances of having a heart attack\nAsk any remaining questions you have about your diabetes care\nEvery three to six months, have your A1C checked by your doctor. A1C gives your average blood glucose over the past two to three months. eAG is your A1C reported in the numbers your blood glucose meter shows.\n\nOnce a year, have a dilated eye exam to check for eye problems, get a flu shot, and have a complete foot exam. \n\nEvery five years, have your cholesterol checked\u2014and check more often if it\u2019s not on target.\n    </p>\n   </div>\n   <div id=\"BZU\">\n    <h3>\n     Live heart-healthy!\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n     None\n    </p>\n   </div>\n  </main>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Loaded with millions of tiny blood vessels that act as filters to remove waste from our blood, kidneys are remarkable organs. \n\nBut unfortunately, this filtering system sometimes breaks down. Failing kidneys lose their ability to filter out waste products, resulting in kidney disease.\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    How does diabetes cause kidney disease?\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    When our bodies digest the protein we eat, the process creates waste products. In the kidneys, millions of tiny blood vessels (capillaries) with even tinier holes in them act as filters. As blood flows through the blood vessels, small molecules such as waste products squeeze through the holes. These waste products become part of the urine. Useful substances, such as protein and red blood cells, are too big to pass through the holes in the filter and stay in the blood.\n\nDiabetes can damage this system. High levels of blood glucose (blood sugar) make the kidneys filter too much blood. All this extra work is hard on the filters. After many years, they start to leak and useful protein is lost in the urine. Having small amounts of protein in the urine is called microalbuminuria.\n\nWhen kidney disease is diagnosed early, during microalbuminuria, several treatments may keep kidney disease from getting worse. Having larger amounts of protein in the urine is called macroalbuminuria. When kidney disease is caught later during macroalbuminuria, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) usually follows.\n\nIn time, the stress of overwork causes the kidneys to lose their filtering ability. Waste products then start to build up in the blood. Finally, the kidneys fail. This failure, ESRD, is very serious. A person with ESRD needs to have a kidney transplant or to have the blood filtered by machine (dialysis).\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    Who gets kidney disease?\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    Not everyone with diabetes develops kidney disease. Factors that can influence kidney disease development include genetics, blood glucose management, and blood pressure.\n\nThe better a person keeps diabetes and blood pressure well-managed, the lower their chance of getting kidney disease.\n   </p>\n   <div id=\"EPX\">\n    <h2>\n     What are the symptoms?\n    </h2>\n    <p>\n     The kidneys work hard to make up for the failing capillaries, so kidney disease produces no symptoms until almost all function is gone. Also, the symptoms of kidney disease are not specific. The first symptom of kidney disease is often fluid buildup. Other symptoms of kidney disease include loss of sleep, poor appetite, upset stomach, weakness, and difficulty concentrating.\n\nIt is vital to see a doctor regularly. The doctor can check blood pressure, urine (for protein), blood (for waste products), and organs for other complications of diabetes.\n    </p>\n   </div>\n   <div id=\"IMB\">\n    <h3>\n     How can I prevent it?\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n     Diabetes-related kidney disease can be prevented by keeping blood glucose in your target range. Research has shown that tight blood glucose management reduces the risk of microalbuminuria by one third. In people who already had microalbuminuria, the risk of progressing to macroalbuminuria was cut in half. Other studies have suggested that tight management can reverse microalbuminuria.\n    </p>\n   </div>\n   <div id=\"ZUW\">\n    <h3>\n     Treatments for Kidney Disease\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n     Self-Care\nImportant treatments for kidney disease are management of blood glucose and blood pressure. Blood pressure has a dramatic effect on the rate at which the disease progresses. Even a mild rise in blood pressure can quickly make kidney disease worsen. Four ways to lower your blood pressure are:\n\nLosing weight, if needed, or maintaining a healthy weight\nEating a kidney-friendly eating plan (see Kidney Friendly Eating Plan section below)\nAvoiding alcohol and tobacco\nGetting regular physical activity\nMedication\nIn addition to these steps and your diabetes medication, certain medications lower blood pressure. There are several kinds of blood pressure drugs. Work with your health care team about other medications that may be helpful for you to lower your risk of kidney disease. \n\nKidney Friendly Eating Plan\nYou can plan a kidney-friendly meal by eating a balanced diet with a variety of whole, minimally processed foods and by following these general meal planning tips: \n\nChoose foods lower in sodium, like whole grains and fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables. Products labeled as \u201clow sodium\u201d may use potassium chloride in place of sodium. Check the ingredient list to make sure you can safely eat low-sodium foods.\nChoose more complex, nutrient-dense carbohydrate sources prepared without much added sugar or fat. \nChoose more heart-healthy fats like olive and avocado oils. \nChoose more plant-based proteins like beans, lentils, and tofu. \nTalk to your health care provider about limiting fluid intake and to your registered dietician nutritionist (RDN) about other nutrition considerations. You may need to limit certain nutrients like sodium, potassium, and phosphorus in your eating plan. Your nutrition care plan might change over time depending on the status of your condition.

      "sub_topic_1_description":"Diabetes is a common condition and is the leading cause of kidney failure in the United States. If you have diabetes and need dialysis, there are several treatment options available. One option you might consider is peritoneal dialysis (PD). Talk to your doctor about treatment options and to determine if PD may be right for you. ",
      "sub_topic_2":"PD and Diabetes",
      "sub_topic_2_description":"People with diabetes often do very well on PD, which is the most common method of home dialysis. PD may allow a person to more easily travel, continue working, raise a family, or go to school. The potential benefits associated with dialyzing at home rather than in a center can be important to people who value their time and need dialysis to work around their schedule.",
      "sub_topic_3":"Blood Glucose and Diabetes Medications",
      "sub_topic_3_description":"Since PD uses sugar-based solutions (glucose) to perform dialysis, people with diabetes starting PD often see a rise in their blood glucose (blood sugar) levels. If you need dialysis, your doctor may adjust your medications. \n\nPD may be an option for you if you have diabetes. Proper monitoring and management of your diabetes will help prevent or delay further complications.",

      "sub_heading_1_description":"Neuropathy\nAlthough it can hurt, diabetic nerve damage can also lessen your ability to feel pain, heat, and cold. Loss of feeling often means you may not feel a foot injury. You could have a tack or stone in your shoe and walk on it all day without knowing. You could get a blister and not feel it. You might not notice a foot injury until the skin breaks down and becomes infected.\n\nNerve damage can also lead to changes in the shape of your feet and toes. If your foot doesn\u2019t fit comfortably in regular shoes, ask your doctor about special therapeutic shoes or inserts, rather than forcing your feet and toes into shoes that don\u2019t fit and can cause more damage. \n\n\nSkin changes\nDiabetes can cause changes in the skin of your foot. At times your foot may become very dry. The skin may peel and crack. This problem is caused by nerve damage that affects your body\u2019s ability to control the oil and moisture in your foot.\n\nAfter bathing, dry your feet and seal in the remaining moisture with a thin coat of plain petroleum jelly, an unscented hand cream, or other such products. Do not put oils or creams between your toes. The extra moisture can lead to infection. Also, don't soak your feet\u2014that can dry your skin.\n\n\nCalluses\nCalluses occur more often and build up faster on the feet of people with diabetes. This is because there are high-pressure areas under the foot. Too much callus may mean that you will need therapeutic shoes and inserts.\n\nCalluses, if not trimmed, get very thick, break down, and turn into ulcers (open sores). Never try to cut calluses or corns yourself\u2014this can lead to ulcers and infection. Let a health care professional on your diabetes care team cut your calluses. Also, do not try to remove calluses and corns with chemical agents. These products can burn your skin.\n\nUsing a pumice stone every day will help keep calluses under control. It is best to use the pumice stone on wet skin. Put on lotion right after you use the pumice stone.\n\n\nPoor circulation\nPoor circulation (blood flow) can make your foot less able to fight infection and to heal. Diabetes causes blood vessels of the foot and leg to narrow and harden. You can control some of the things that cause poor blood flow. Don't smoke; smoking makes arteries harden faster. Also, follow your diabetes care team's advice for keeping your blood pressure and cholesterol under control.\n\nIf your feet are cold, you may want to warm them. Keep aware that, unfortunately, if you have nerve damage, your feet may not be able feel heat properly and it is easy for you to burn them with hot water, hot water bottles, or heating pads. The best way to warm cold feet is to wear warm socks.\n\nSome people feel pain in their calves when walking fast, up a hill, or on a hard surface. This condition is called intermittent claudication. Stopping to rest for a few moments should end the pain. If you have these symptoms, you must stop smoking. Work with your diabetes care team to get started on a walking program. Some people can also be helped with medication to improve circulation.\n\nExercise is good for poor circulation. It stimulates blood flow in the legs and feet. Walk in sturdy, comfortable shoes that fit comfortably, but don't walk when you have open sores on your feet.\n\n\nFoot ulcers\nUlcers occur most often on the ball of the foot or on the bottom of the big toe. Ulcers on the sides of the foot are usually due to poorly fitting shoes. Remember, even though some ulcers do not hurt, every ulcer should be seen by your doctor right away. Neglecting ulcers can result in infections, which in turn can lead to loss of a limb.\n\nWhat your doctor will do varies with your ulcer. Your doctor may need to take x-rays of your foot to make sure the bone is not infected. The ulcer may also need to have any dead and infected tissue cleaned out. You may need to go into the hospital for this cleaning. Also, a culture of the wound may be used to find out what type of infection you have and which antibiotic will work best.\n\nKeeping off your feet is very important. Walking on an ulcer can enlarge it and force the infection deeper into your foot. Your doctor may put a special shoe, brace, or cast on your foot to protect it.\n\nIf your ulcer is not healing and your circulation is poor, you may be referred to a vascular surgeon. Managing diabetes is important since high blood glucose (blood sugar) levels make it hard to fight infection.\n\nAfter a foot ulcer heals, treat your foot carefully. Scar tissue from the wound will break down easily. You may need to wear special shoes after the ulcer is healed to protect this area and to prevent the ulcer from returning.\n \n\n\nAmputation\nPeople with diabetes are far more likely to have a foot or leg amputated than other people. The problem? Many people with diabetes have peripheral artery disease (PAD), which reduces blood flow to the feet. Also, many people with diabetes have neuropathy, causing you to not feel your feet. Together, these problems make it easy to get ulcers and infections that may lead to amputation. Most amputations are preventable by checking your feet daily, go to regular visits with your doctor, and wear proper footwear.\n\nFor these reasons, take good care of your feet and see your doctor right away if you see any signs of foot problems. Ask about prescription shoes that are covered by Medicare and other insurance. Always follow your doctor's advice when caring for ulcers or other foot problems.\n\nOne of the biggest threats to your feet is smoking. Smoking affects small blood vessels. It can cause decreased blood flow to the feet and make wounds heal slowly. A lot of people with diabetes who need amputations are smokers.",

These include bacterial infections, fungal infections, and itching. Other skin problems happen mostly, or only, to people with diabetes. These include diabetic dermopathy, necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum, diabetic blisters, and eruptive xanthomatosis. Expand the items below to learn more about each skin condition and discover helpful skin care tips.\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    General skin conditions\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    Bacterial infections\nSeveral kinds of bacterial infections occur in people with diabetes:\n\nStyes (infections of the glands of the eyelid)\nBoils\nFolliculitis (infections of the hair follicles)\nCarbuncles (deep infections of the skin and the tissue underneath)\nInfections around the nails\nInflamed tissues are usually hot, swollen, red, and painful. Several different organisms can cause infections, the most common being Staphylococcus bacteria, also called staph.\n\nBacterial infections were once life threatening, especially for people with diabetes. Today, death is rare, thanks to antibiotics and better methods of blood glucose (blood sugar) control.\n\nBut even today, people with diabetes have more bacterial infections than other people do. Doctors believe people with diabetes can reduce their chances of these infections by practicing good skin care.\n\nIf you think you have a bacterial infection, see your doctor.\n \n\n\nFungal infections\nThe culprit in fungal infections of people with diabetes is often Candida albicans. This yeast-like fungus can create itchy rashes of moist, red areas surrounded by tiny blisters and scales. These infections often occur in warm, moist folds of the skin. Problem areas are under the breasts, around the nails, between fingers and toes, in the corners of the mouth, under the foreskin (in uncircumcised men), and in the armpits and groin.\n\nCommon fungal infections include jock itch, athlete's foot, ringworm (a ring-shaped itchy patch), and vaginal infection that causes itching.\n\nIf you think you have a yeast or fungal infection, call your doctor.\n \n\n\nItching\nLocalized itching is often caused by diabetes. It can be caused by a yeast infection, dry skin, or poor circulation. When poor circulation is the cause of itching, the itchiest areas may be the lower parts of the legs.\n\nYou may be able to treat itching yourself. Limit how often you bathe, particularly when the humidity is low. Use mild soap with moisturizer and apply skin cream after bathing.\n   </p>\n   <div id=\"KJJ\">\n    <h2>\n     Good skin care\n    </h2>\n    <p>\n     There are several things you can do to prevent skin problems:\n\nKeep your diabetes well managed. People with high glucose levels tend to have dry skin and less ability to fend off harmful bacteria. Both conditions increase the risk of infection.\nKeep skin clean and dry. \nAvoid very hot baths and showers. If your skin is dry, don't use bubble baths. Moisturizing soaps may help. Afterward, use a standard skin lotion, but don't put lotions between toes. The extra moisture there can encourage fungus to grow.\nPrevent dry skin. Scratching dry or itchy skin can open it up and allow infection to set in. Moisturize your skin to prevent chapping, especially in cold or windy weather.\nTreat cuts right away. Wash minor cuts with soap and water. Only use an antibiotic cream or ointment if your doctor says it's okay. Cover minor cuts with sterile gauze. See a doctor right away if you get a major cut, burn, or infection.\nDuring cold, dry months, keep your home more humid. Bathe less during this weather, if possible.\nUse mild shampoos. \nDo not use feminine hygiene sprays.\nSee a dermatologist (skin doctor) about skin problems if you are not able to solve them yourself.\nTake good care of your feet.

Sometimes they also occur on the hands, elbows, and knees.\n\nAcanthosis nigricans usually strikes people who are very overweight. The best treatment is to lose weight. Some creams can help the spots look better.\n \n\n\nDiabetic dermopathy\nDiabetes can cause changes in the small blood vessels. These changes can cause skin problems called diabetic dermopathy.\n\nDermopathy often looks like light brown, scaly patches. These patches may be oval or circular. Some people mistake them for age spots. This disorder most often occurs on the front of both legs. But the legs may not be affected to the same degree. The patches do not hurt, open up, or itch.\n\nDermopathy is harmless and doesn't need to be treated.\n \n\n\nNecrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum\nAnother disease that may be caused by changes in the blood vessels is necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum (NLD). NLD causes spots similar to diabetic dermopathy, but they are fewer, larger, and deeper.\n\nNLD often starts as a dull, red, raised area. After a while, it looks like a shiny scar with a violet border. The blood vessels under the skin may become easier to see. Sometimes NLD is itchy and painful. Sometimes the spots crack open.\n\nNLD is a rare condition. Adult women are the most likely to get it. As long as the sores do not break open, you do not need to have it treated. But if you get open sores, see your doctor for treatment.\n \n\n\nAllergic reactions\nAllergic skin reactions can occur in response to medicines, such as insulin or diabetes pills. You should see your doctor if you think you are having a reaction to a medicine. Be on the lookout for rashes, depressions, or bumps at the sites where you inject insulin.\n\n\nDiabetic blisters (bullosis diabeticorum)\nRarely, people with diabetes erupt in blisters. Diabetic blisters can occur on the backs of fingers, hands, toes, feet, and sometimes on legs or forearms. These sores look like burn blisters and often occur in people who have diabetic neuropathy. They are sometimes large, but they are painless and have no redness around them. They heal by themselves, usually without scars, in about three weeks. The only treatment is to bring blood glucose levels under control.\n\n\nEruptive xanthomatosis\nEruptive xanthomatosis is another condition caused by diabetes that's out of control. It consists of firm, yellow, pea-like enlargements in the skin. Each bump has a red halo and may itch. This condition occurs most often on the backs of hands, feet, arms, legs, and buttocks.\n\nThe disorder usually occurs in young men with type 1 diabetes. The person often has high levels of cholesterol and fat in the blood. Like diabetic blisters, these bumps disappear when diabetes control is restored.\n \n\n\nDigital sclerosis\nSometimes, people with diabetes develop tight, thick, waxy skin on the backs of their hands. Sometimes skin on the toes and forehead also becomes thick. The finger joints become stiff and can no longer move the way they should. Rarely, knees, ankles, or elbows also get stiff.\n\nThis condition happens to about one third of people who have type 1 diabetes. The only treatment is to bring blood glucose levels under control.\n\n\nDisseminated granuloma annulare\nIn disseminated granuloma annulare, the person has sharply defined ring- or arc-shaped raised areas on the skin. These rashes occur most often on parts of the body far from the torso (for example, the fingers or ears). But sometimes the raised areas occur on the torso. They can be red, red-brown, or skin-colored.\n\nSee your doctor if you get rashes like this. There are medications that can help clear up this condition.\n    </p>\n   </div>\n  </main>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Limit how often you bathe, particularly when the humidity is low. Use mild soap with moisturizer and apply skin cream after bathing.",

DKA is caused by an overload of ketones present in your blood. \n\nWhen your cells don't get the glucose they need for energy, your body begins to burn fat for energy, which produces ketones. Ketones are chemicals that the body creates when it breaks down fat to use for energy. The body does this when it doesn\u2019t have enough insulin to use glucose, the body\u2019s normal source of energy. When ketones build up in the blood, they make it more acidic. They are a warning sign that your diabetes is out of control or that you are getting sick.\n\nHigh levels of ketones can poison the body. When levels get too high, you can develop DKA. DKA may happen to anyone with diabetes, though it is rare in people with type 2. \n\nTreatment for DKA usually takes place in the hospital. But you can help prevent it by learning the warning signs and checking your urine and blood regularly.\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    What are the warning signs of DKA?\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    DKA usually develops slowly. But when vomiting occurs, this life-threatening condition can develop in a few hours. Early symptoms include the following:\n\nThirst or a very dry mouth\nFrequent urination\nHigh blood glucose (blood sugar) levels\nHigh levels of ketones in the urine\nThen, other symptoms appear:\n\nConstantly feeling tired\nDry or flushed skin\nNausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. Vomiting can be caused by many illnesses, not just ketoacidosis. If vomiting continues for more than two hours, contact your health care provider.\nDifficulty breathing\nFruity odor on breath\nA hard time paying attention, or confusion\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    More on ketones and DKA\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    How do I check for ketones?\nYou can detect ketones with a simple urine test using a test strip, similar to a blood testing strip. Ask your health care provider when and how you should test for ketones.

DKA is caused by an overload of ketones present in your blood. \n\nWhen your cells don't get the glucose they need for energy, your body begins to burn fat for energy, which produces ketones. Ketones are chemicals that the body creates when it breaks down fat to use for energy. The body does this when it doesn\u2019t have enough insulin to use glucose, the body\u2019s normal source of energy. When ketones build up in the blood, they make it more acidic. They are a warning sign that your diabetes is out of control or that you are getting sick.\n\nHigh levels of ketones can poison the body. When levels get too high, you can develop DKA. DKA may happen to anyone with diabetes, though it is rare in people with type 2. \n\nTreatment for DKA usually takes place in the hospital. But you can help prevent it by learning the warning signs and checking your urine and blood regularly.",

That\u2019s just 30 minutes a day, five days a week.\n\nThe CDC-led National Diabetes Prevention Program (National DPP) can help people make the lifestyle changes needed to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes. Through the program, participants:\n\nWork with a trained coach to make lasting lifestyle changes.\nDiscover how to eat healthy and add more physical activity into their day.\nFind out how to manage stress, stay motivated, and solve problems that can slow progress.\nIf you have prediabetes, ask your health care provider about the National DPP lifestyle change program. The best time to prevent type 2 diabetes is now.",

Eat more fresh fruits and vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains. Eat fewer processed foods (such as chips, sweets, and fast food) and avoid trans fat. Drink more water, fewer sugary drinks, and less alcohol.\nAim for a healthy weight. If you\u2019re overweight, losing even a modest amount of weight can lower your triglycerides and blood sugar. Modest weight loss means 5% to 7% of body weight, just 10 to 14 pounds for a 200-pound person.\nGet active. Being physically active makes your body more sensitive to insulin (the hormone that allows cells in your body to use blood sugar for energy), which helps manage your diabetes. Physical activity also helps control blood sugar levels and lowers your risk of heart disease. Try to get at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity, such as brisk walking.\nManage your ABCs:\nA: Get a regular A1C test to measure your average blood sugar over 2 to 3 months; aim to stay in your target range as much as possible.\nB: Try to keep your blood pressure below 140/90 mm Hg (or the target your doctor sets).\nC: Manage your cholesterol levels.\ns: Stop smoking or don\u2019t start.\nManage stress. Stress can raise your blood pressure and can also lead to unhealthy behaviors, such as drinking too much alcohol or overeating.

The term \u201ccardiovascular disease\u201d is similar but includes all types of heart disease, stroke, and blood vessel disease. The most common type is coronary artery disease, which affects blood flow to the heart.\n\nCoronary artery disease is caused by the buildup of plaque in the walls of the coronary arteries, the blood vessels that supply oxygen and blood to the heart. Plaque is made of cholesterol deposits, which make the inside of arteries narrow and decrease blood flow. This process is called atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries. Decreased blood flow to the heart can cause a heart attack. Decreased blood flow to the brain can cause a stroke.\n\nHardening of the arteries can happen in other parts of the body too. In the legs and feet, it\u2019s called peripheral arterial disease, or PAD. PAD is often the first sign that a person with diabetes has cardiovascular disease.",
      "sub_topic_2":"How Diabetes Affects Your Heart",
      "sub_topic_2_description":"Over time, high blood sugar can damage blood vessels and the nerves that control your heart. People with diabetes are also more likely to have other conditions that raise the risk for heart disease:\n\nHigh blood pressure increases the force of blood through your arteries and can damage artery walls. Having both high blood pressure and diabetes can greatly increase your risk for heart disease.\nToo much LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol in your bloodstream can form plaque on damaged artery walls.\nHigh triglycerides (a type of fat in your blood) and low HDL (\u201cgood\u201d) cholesterol or high LDL cholesterol is thought to contribute to hardening of the arteries.\nNone of these conditions has symptoms. Your doctor can check your blood pressure and do a simple blood test to see if your LDL, HDL, and triglyceride levels are high.\n\nThese factors can also raise your risk for heart disease:\n\nSmoking\nBeing overweight or having obesity\nNot getting enough physical activity\nEating a diet high in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, and sodium (salt)\nDrinking too much alcohol\nPeople with diabetes are also more likely to have heart failure. Heart failure is a serious condition, but it doesn\u2019t mean the heart has stopped beating; it means your heart can\u2019t pump blood well. This can lead to swelling in your legs and fluid building up in your lungs, making it hard to breathe. Heart failure tends to get worse over time, but early diagnosis and treatment can help relieve symptoms and stop or delay the condition getting worse.",

Your heartbeat is the result of an electrical impulse traveling through your heart.\nAn echocardiogram (echo) to examine how thick your heart muscle is and how well your heart pumps.\nAn exercise stress test (treadmill test) to see how well your heart functions when it\u2019s working hard.",

Put your feet up when you\u2019re sitting, and wiggle your toes for a few minutes several times throughout the day.\n\nChoose feet-friendly activities like walking, riding a bike, or swimming.

The good news is managing your diabetes and getting regular eye exams can help prevent vision problems and stop them from getting worse.\n\nEye diseases that can affect people with diabetes include diabetic retinopathy, macular edema (which usually develops along with diabetic retinopathy), cataracts, and glaucoma.

If you have type 1 diabetes, you should be checked within 5 years of your diagnosis and then regularly thereafter, typically every year. The sooner you\u2019re treated for diabetic retinopathy, the better that treatment will work.\n\nCall your eye doctor if you notice changes in your vision, especially if they happen suddenly.

This creates a barrier of scar tissue that slows the growth of new blood vessels.\nMedicines called VEGF inhibitors, which can slow down or reverse diabetic retinopathy.\nRemoving all or part of the vitreous (vitrectomy).\nReattachment of the retina (for retinal detachment, a complication of diabetic retinopathy).\nInjection of medicines called corticosteroids.",
      "sub_heading_3":"Other Eye Diseases",
      "sub_heading_3_description":"Cataract\nA cataract  is the clouding of the normally clear lens in your eye. Though everyone\u2019s lenses tend to get cloudy as they get older, people with diabetes are more likely to have cataracts, and at a younger age. One reason is that high blood sugar can cause deposits to build up in the lenses and make them cloudy.\n\nOther risk factors include high blood pressure, having obesity, too much sun exposure over time, and smoking.\n\nSurgery is the only way to treat cataracts, but you usually don\u2019t have to have surgery right away. Using brighter lights in your home and anti-glare sunglasses outside can help early on. If your cataracts get in the way of doing everyday activities, it may be time for surgery. The good news is the surgery is very safe, and most people have better vision afterwards!\n\n\nGlaucoma\nGlaucoma is a group of eye diseases that damage the optic nerve, usually because of too much pressure in the eye. Many types of glaucoma don\u2019t have symptoms, and vision loss can happen so slowly that you don\u2019t notice it.\n\nPeople with diabetes are twice as likely to develop open-angle glaucoma, the most common type. Other risk factors include having a family history of glaucoma, being over age 60, and being African American, Asian, or Hispanic/Latino.\n\nDiabetes can also cause neovascular glaucoma. This happens sometimes with diabetic retinopathy when new and abnormal blood vessels grow on the iris (the colored part of the eye). The new vessels can block off the flow of fluid out of the eye, which raises eye pressure.\n\nThere isn\u2019t a way to prevent glaucoma, but treatment can help stop it from getting worse. That\u2019s why catching glaucoma early is so important. Treatment options include medicines, laser treatment, and surgery. Talk to your eye doctor about what choices are best for you.",

These pouches can leak blood and other fluid, which can cause a part of the retina called the macula to swell (macular edema) and distort your vision. Macular edema is the most common cause of blindness in people with diabetic retinopathy. About half of people with diabetic retinopathy will develop macular edema.\n\nAdvanced stage (proliferative): In this stage, the retina begins to grow new blood vessels. These new vessels are fragile and often bleed into the vitreous (the clear gel between the lens and retina). With minor bleeding, you may see a few dark spots that float in your vision. If there\u2019s a lot of bleeding, your vision may be completely blocked.\n\nYou may not notice symptoms in the early stage. That\u2019s why it\u2019s very important to get a dilated eye exam at least once a year to catch any problems early when treatment is most effective.\n\nSymptoms in the advanced stage can include:\n\nBlurry vision\nSpots or dark shapes in your vision (floaters)\nTrouble seeing colors\nDark or empty areas in your vision\nVision loss",

Having diabetes means that you need to check your blood sugar levels often, make healthy food choices, be physically active, remember to take your medicine, and make other good decisions about your health several times a day. In addition, you may also worry about having low or high blood sugar levels, the costs of your medicines, and developing diabetes-related complications, such as heart disease or nerve damage.\n\nHaving diabetes can be overwhelming at times. The good news is that there are things you can do to cope with diabetes and manage stress.\nWhen all of this feels like too much to deal with, you may have something called diabetes distress. This is when all the worry, frustration, anger, and burnout makes it hard for you to take care of yourself and keep up with the daily demands of diabetes.\n\nThe good news is that there are things you can do to cope with diabetes and manage stress. Here are 10 tips that can help.\n\nPay attention to your feelings. Almost everyone feels frustrated or stressed from time to time. Dealing with diabetes can add to these feelings and make you feel overwhelmed. Having these feelings for more than a week or two may signal that you need help coping with your diabetes so that you can feel better.\nTalk with your health care providers about your feelings. Let your doctor, nurse, diabetes educator, psychologist, or social worker know how you\u2019ve been feeling. They can help you problem-solve your concerns about diabetes. They may also suggest that you speak with other health care providers to get help.\nTalk to your health care providers about negative reactions other people may have about your diabetes. Your health care providers can help you manage feelings of being judged by others because you have diabetes. It is important not to feel that you have to hide your diabetes from other people.\nAsk if help is available for the costs of diabetes medicines and supplies. If you are worried about the cost of your medicines, talk with your pharmacist and other health care providers. They may know about government or other programs that can assist people with costs. You can also check with community health centers to see if they know about programs that help people get insulin, diabetes medicines, and supplies (test trips, syringes, etc.).\nTalk with your family and friends. Tell those closest to you how you feel about having diabetes. Be honest about the problems you\u2019re having in dealing with diabetes. Just telling others how you feel helps to relieve some of the stress. However, sometimes the people around you may add to your stress. Let them know how and when you need them to help you.\nAllow loved ones to help you take care of your diabetes. Those closest to you can help you in several ways. They can remind you to take your medicines, help monitor your blood sugar levels, join you in being physically active, and prepare healthy meals. They can also learn more about diabetes and go with you when you visit your doctor. Ask your loved ones to help with your diabetes in ways that are useful to you.\nTalk to other people with diabetes. Other people with diabetes understand some of the things you are going through. Ask them how they deal with their diabetes and what works for them. They can help you feel less lonely and overwhelmed. Ask your health care providers about diabetes support groups in your community or online.\nDo one thing at a time. When you think about everything you need to do to manage your diabetes, it can be overwhelming. To deal with diabetes distress, make a list of all of the tasks you have to do to take care of yourself each day. Try to work on each task separately, one at a time.\nPace yourself. As you work on your goals, like increasing physical activity, take it slowly. You don\u2019t have to meet your goals immediately. Your goal may be to walk 10 minutes, three times a day each day of the week, but you can start by walking two times a day or every other day.\nTake time to do things you enjoy. Give yourself a break! Set aside time in your day to do something you really love; it could be calling a friend, playing a game with your children or grandchildren, or working on a fun project. Find out about activities near you that you can do with a friend.\nRemember that it\u2019s important to pay attention to your feelings. If you notice that you\u2019re feeling frustrated, tired, and unable to make decisions about your diabetes care, take action. Tell your family, friends, and health care providers. They can help you get the support you need.",

That\u2019s because when your body releases hormones to fight the illness, those hormones can also raise your blood sugar levels and increase how much insulin you need. This is especially important for people with type 1 diabetes since they depend on insulin to live.\n\nWhen your body doesn\u2019t have enough insulin, it starts breaking down fat as fuel, which produces ketones. When too many ketones are produced too fast, they can cause diabetic ketoacidosis, or DKA. DKA is very serious and can cause a coma or even death.\n\nIf you think you may have DKA, use an over-the-counter kit to test your urine for ketones. If ketones are present, call your doctor right away. You\u2019ll probably need to go to the hospital for treatment.\n\nFollow these additional steps when you\u2019re sick even if your blood sugar is within your target range:\n\nContinue taking your insulin and diabetes pills as usual.\nTest your blood sugar every 4 hours and keep track of the results.\nDrink extra calorie-free liquids*, and try to eat as you normally would.\nWeigh yourself every day. Losing weight without trying is a sign of high blood glucose.\nCheck your temperature every morning and evening. A fever may be a sign of infection.\n*Drink plenty of fluids \u2013 4 to 6 ounces every half-hour \u2013 to prevent dehydration. You may also need to drink beverages with sugar if you cannot get 50 grams of carbohydrates every 4 hours from other food choices. Drink small portions of these sweet beverages to keep your blood sugar from getting too high.",

      "description":"You may not get down to the number you saw on the scale 20 years ago, but you can still get to a weight that enhances your health and your life.\n\nFirst, what does \u201chealthy weight\u201d mean to you? Is it the weight you think you should be? The same as you weighed 20 years ago? Ten pounds less than your sister-in-law? We can\u2019t provide an exact number for you personally, but we can give you some pointers on how to get to a weight that\u2019s healthy for you and stay there.\n\nTwo ways to get a ballpark idea if your weight is healthy or not: body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference.\n\nBMI measures your height compared to your weight. For example, a person who is 5\u20197\u201d and weighs 170 pounds has a BMI of 26.6, which is in the overweight range:\n\nWeight status and BMI\nWeight status\tBMI\nUnderweight\tLess than 18.5\nNormal\t18.5\u201324.9\nOverweight\t25\u201329.9\nObesity\t30 or greater\n\nBut experts note that BMI doesn\u2019t measure belly fat, and that\u2019s important. Too much belly fat can increase your risk for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Waist circumference (waist size) takes belly fat into account and helps predict your risk of health problems from being overweight. Women whose waist measures more than 35 inches and men whose waist measures more than 40 inches are at higher risk. Losing weight can reduce belly fat and lower that risk!\n\nTo measure your waist correctly, stand and place a tape measure around your middle, just above your hipbones. Measure your waist just after you breathe out.",

Control your environment so temptation is out of the picture and healthy habits are in. Some ideas:\n\nDon\u2019t bring home food you don\u2019t want to eat. Make home a safe zone!\nAvoid buffet-style restaurants.\nDon\u2019t let yourself get too hungry.\nCook your own food so you can control the calories.\nLay out your workout clothes before you go to sleep.\nKeep the dog\u2019s leash and your walking shoes by the door.",
      "sub_heading_2":"Sleep Helps",
      "sub_heading_2_description":"Too little sleep makes dieting much harder because it increases your hunger and appetite, especially for high-calorie, high-carb foods. Too little sleep also triggers stress hormones, which tell your body to hang onto fat. Outsmart this problem by being physically active, which has been shown to help you fall asleep faster and sleep better. A relaxing nighttime routine can also help you get your zzz\u2019s.

If you have diabetes, you may find your blood sugar levels are easier to manage and that you need less diabetes medicine after you lose weight. Many people who lose weight notice that they have more energy and sleep better too.\n\nA healthy weight goal is one thing; dropping the pounds is quite another. If there were an easy way to lose weight and keep it off, everyone would be doing it. We\u2019ve all known someone who follows a popular diet plan and loses weight fast but then gains it all back (and then some).

Some people cut back on sugar and eat more protein to stay fuller longer. Others focus on filling up with extra fruits and vegetables, which leaves less room for unhealthy food. Still others limit variety for most meals and stick with choices that they know are healthy and filling. The details will depend on what you like and what fits in best with your life.

      "sub_topic_3_description":"Physical activity can make you feel better, function better, and sleep better. You\u2019re not likely to lose a lot of weight with physical activity alone, but combining it with your diet strategy can improve weight loss. Here are the basic guidelines:\n\nEvery week: do at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity, such as brisk walking, or 75 minutes of vigorous activity, such as jogging, or an equivalent combination of the two.\nTwo or more days a week: do strength-training activities, such as lifting weights or using a resistance band, that involve all major muscle groups.\nIf you have diabetes, physical activity can help you manage the condition along with your weight. Being active makes you more sensitive to insulin (the hormone that allows cells in your body to use blood sugar for energy). Your body won\u2019t need to make as much insulin or you won\u2019t need to take as much. Lower insulin levels can help prevent fat storage and weight gain. Learn more about being active when you have diabetes here.\n\nWhile how you lose weight will be highly personalized, these pointers have helped others reach their goal and could help you, too.",
      "sub_topic_4":"More Tips",
      "sub_topic_4_description":"Eat higher-protein, lower-carb meals to control hunger and appetite. For people with diabetes who take insulin, eating fewer carbs like bread, pasta, rice, desserts, sugary beverages, and juice can lower how much insulin they need. Using less insulin can help prevent hunger, fat storage, and weight gain.\nChoose carbs that are higher in fiber and lower in added sugar. For example, say yes to beans and sweet potatoes; say no to sugary drinks and chips.\nDrink more water and fewer sweetened beverages. This one change can cut lots of calories and mean fewer blood sugar swings!\nKeep moving. Physical activity helps you stay motivated and keep the weight off.\nLearn from a bad day. Everyone slips up from time to time; figure out what went wrong and plan for it next time. You\u2019re only human, and humans are great learners.",

If you\u2019re not already physically active you should begin slowly and work your way up to the desired level. For example, you could park farther from the door, take the stairs, do yard work, or walk the dog. Start small and gradually add a little more time and intensity each week.\n\nFind a partner. It\u2019s more fun when someone else is counting on you to show up. Having a partner may help you continue to be active.\n\nPick a goal. An example of a goal could be to walk a mile every day for a month or to be active every weekday for 30 minutes. Be specific and realistic. Always discuss your activity goals with your health care provider.\n\nSchedule it in. The more regular activity you do, the quicker it will become a habit. Think of ways to link activity to daily life. For example, you could schedule walking with a co-worker after lunch. Try not to go more than 2 days in a row without being active.",

Although you will have an increased risk of developing diabetes in later life.\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about gestational diabetes then discuss this with your midwife.\n\nBlood glucose control is also very important for women with diabetes before pregnancy (type 1, type 2 or other kinds). If you\u2019re planning a pregnancy or are in the early stages of pregnancy, it\u2019s important to discuss this with your GP, midwife or hospital clinic.",

They can sometimes cause side effects, including weight gain, nausea and diarrhoea.",

You should aim for a hypo to be treated and to recheck your blood glucose level within 15 minutes.\n\nIf blood glucose still less than 4mmol/l then repeat the treatment using a fast acting carbohydrate. When your blood glucose returns to normal then have your longer acting carbohydrate.\n\nIf you develop severe hypoglycaemia, you may become drowsy and confused, and you may even lose consciousness.\n\nIf this occurs, you may need to have an injection of glucagon into your muscle or glucose into a vein. Glucagon is a hormone that quickly increases your blood glucose levels.\n\nYou may require input from a health care professional. If the glucagon is not successful, you may require an injection of dextrose into your vein.\n\nYour diabetes care team can advise you on how to avoid a hypo and what to do if you have one.",

In more severe cases, you may also feel confused and have difficulty concentrating. In very severe cases, a person experiencing hypoglycaemia can lose consciousness.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible for hypoglycaemia to occur during sleep, which can cause excess sweating, disturbed sleep, and feeling tired and confused upon waking.",

Understandably, people may worry or feel uncertain about what the spread of the virus means for them or their loved ones. Times are uncertain, but please try not to worry. It\u2019s not as bad as the media can sometimes make it out to be.\n\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses which have been around for a long time and can cause illness. In humans, coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections from a common cold to more severe diseases.\n\nThe coronavirus disease COVID-19 that is currently in the news is caused by a newly discovered type of coronavirus. Prior to the outbreak in Wuhan, China in December 2019, this new virus and the disease were unknown.",

It is one of the underlying conditions reported to be associated with the onset of more severe symptoms in individuals affected by the coronavirus.\n\n\nHowever, there are steps to take to keep your blood glucose levels well controlled to help reduce your risk of becoming ill. Eating well, testing blood sugars regularly, reducing stress and getting plenty of sleep can help with blood sugar control.\n\nDan Howarth, head of care at Diabetes UK, said: \u201cCoronavirus or Covid-19 can cause complications in people with diabetes.\n\n\u201cIf you have diabetes and you have symptoms such as cough, high temperature and feeling short of breath, you need to monitor your blood sugar closely and call the NHS 111 phone service.\u201d",

      "sub_heading_2_description":"There are actions you can take to reduce your risk of contracting the virus and help limit the spread among communities.\n\n1. Wash your hands regularly\nIt might sound simple, but regular hand washing is important as it can help kill any viruses that may be on your hands.\n\nYou should thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds (handy tip \u2013 sing happy birthday to yourself twice whilst washing). Take notice of areas you might miss including the back of your hands, between your fingers and around the nails. Or use an alcohol-based hand rub. The NHS recommends ensuring you wash your hands when you get home or arrive at work.\n\n2. Maintain a distance\nAvoid close contact with people who are unwell. Keeping at least a 1-meter (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing/ sneezing is recommended by The World Health Organisation.\n\n3. Practice good hygiene\nBe sure to cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. You should not use your hands to do this. Covering your mouth and nose with a tissue or your bent elbow is more appropriate. It is important to dispose of used tissues immediately and thoroughly wash your hands afterwards.\n\n4. Keep your hands away from your face\nOur hands touch many surfaces and can transfer a virus from surfaces into your body. A simple step to minimise this risk is to avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean.\n\n5. Stay informed and follow official advice\nThe spread of the coronavirus is an ongoing situation. It is important to stay informed with the latest information and to protect yourself and others from COVID-19 following advice from your healthcare provider, your national and local public health authority.",

      "description":"By learning the causes and symptoms of type 2 diabetes, you can delay or prevent it altogether. The primary indicator of type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance, when the body cannot fully respond to insulin. \n\nBecause insulin cannot work properly, blood glucose levels keep rising, releasing more insulin. Unfortunately, for some people with type 2 diabetes, this can eventually exhaust the pancreas. As a result, the body produces less and less insulin, causing even higher blood glucose levels (hyperglycaemia).\n\nAccounting for around 90% of all diabetes, type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes. Changes in diet and physical activity related to rapid development and urbanisation have led to sharp increases in people with type 2 diabetes. Previously, mainly older adults developed the condition. However, due to rising levels of obesity, sedentary lifestyles and poor diet, type 2 diabetes is increasing in children, adolescents and younger adults.",

      "sub_heading_1":"Oral medicines for type 2 diabetes",
      "sub_heading_1_description":"The most commonly used oral medications for type 2 diabetes include:\n\nMetformin: a medicine that reduces insulin resistance and allows the body to use its insulin more effectively. It is regarded as the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes in most guidelines worldwide.\nSulfonylureas: a medicine that stimulates the pancreas to increase insulin production. Sulfonylureas include gliclazide, glipizide, glimepiride, tolbutamide and glibenclamide.",
      "sub_heading_2":"Which type of exercise is best and when",
      "sub_heading_2_description":"Recent studies examining the benefits of physical activity on blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes show that, although any form of exercise is beneficial, specific activities and their timing can significantly enhance your health.\n\nWith so many different exercise types available, deciding which is the most effective can be overwhelming. The best solution is to choose one that works best for you. This may depend on factors such as your current fitness level, preferences and any other health conditions you may have.\n\nAlways consider factors like fitness level and preferences when choosing your activity.\n\nOne highly recommended exercise for people with diabetes is cardio which includes walking, jogging, swimming or cycling. Cardio helps improve cardiovascular health and aids in weight management, both essential for managing diabetes. It also helps increase insulin sensitivity, allowing your body to regulate blood sugar levels better.\n\nStrength training also has its advantages. You can increase muscle mass and improve insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control by using weights or resistance bands to strengthen muscles. Additionally, strength training helps prevent muscle loss, which is common in people with diabetes.\n\nAlong with cardio exercise and strength training, flexibility exercises are also beneficial. These exercises focus on stretching and improving joint mobility. They can help to reduce the risk of injury and improve overall physical performance. Examples of flexibility exercises include yoga, Pilates and stretching routines.\n\nAs for how often to exercise, consistency is key. You should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, spread out over several days, possibly in shorter bouts of 10-15 minutes. Aim to do strength training at least twice weekly, targeting all major muscle groups. \n\nTo reap the benefits of your routine, consider the time of day you exercise. According to studies, moderate to vigorous physical activity in the afternoon and evening significantly impacts blood sugar control more than morning exercise and may help reduce insulin resistance and liver fat content.\n\nIn short, any movement is good, and more is generally better, especially when well-timed.",
      "sub_heading_3":"Delaying or preventing type 2 diabetes",
      "sub_heading_3_description":"Several factors influence the development of type 2 diabetes. The most significant are lifestyle behaviours commonly associated with urbanisation. Consistent evidence shows that a relatively modest intentional weight loss achieved through a healthy diet and regular physical activity can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes.\n\nA healthy diet includes:\n\nreducing calories if you are overweight\nreplacing saturated fats (eg cream, cheese, butter) with unsaturated fats (eg avocado, nuts, olive and vegetable oils)\neating dietary fibre (eg fruit, vegetables, whole grains)\ncontrolling portion sizes to avoid overeating\navoiding tobacco use, excessive alcohol and added sugar\nchoosing healthier cooking methods such as baking, grilling, steaming, or saut\u00e9ing instead of frying\nRegular health check-ups are also recommended as early detection of the risk factors can help take proactive steps to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes.",

It is slower-acting than rapid-acting insulin but may be more suitable for some people. Actrapid, Humulin R, and Insuman Rapid are examples of short-acting insulin.\n\nIntermediate-acting is usually taken with a short-acting one. It begins working within an hour of injection and reaches its peak activity within seven hours. Examples of intermediate-acting insulin are Humulin NPH, Protaphane, and Insulatard.\n\nLong-acting can last up to 24 hours in the body and are usually taken in the morning or before bed. Some examples are Detemir and Glargine.\n\nTwo common insulin treatment plans include:\nTwice-daily insulin: using both short-acting and intermediate-acting insulin.\n\nBasal bolus regimen: short-acting insulin taken with main meals (usually three times a day) and intermediate-acting insulin given once or twice daily (evening or morning and evening).",

The risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with the number of affected family members. The increased risk is likely due in part to shared genetic factors, but it is also related to lifestyle influences (such as eating and exercise habits) that are shared by members of a family.",

      "sub_topic_1":"Description",
      "sub_topic_1_description":"Type 2 diabetes is a disorder characterized by abnormally high levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. In this form of diabetes, the body stops using and making insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas that helps regulate blood glucose levels. Specifically, insulin controls how much glucose (a type of sugar) is passed from the blood into cells, where it is used as an energy source. When blood glucose levels are high (such as after a meal), the pancreas releases insulin to move the excess glucose into cells, which reduces the amount of glucose in the blood.\n\nMost people who develop type 2 diabetes first have insulin resistance, a condition in which the body's cells use insulin less efficiently than normal. As insulin resistance develops, more and more insulin is needed to keep blood glucose levels in the normal range. To keep up with the increasing need, insulin-producing cells in the pancreas (called beta cells) make larger amounts of insulin. Over time, the beta cells become less able to respond to blood glucose changes, leading to an insulin shortage that prevents the body from reducing blood glucose levels effectively. Most people have some insulin resistance as they age, but inadequate exercise and excessive weight gain make it worse, greatly increasing the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes.\n\nType 2 diabetes can occur at any age, but it most commonly begins in middle age or later. Signs and symptoms develop slowly over years. They include frequent urination (polyuria), excessive thirst (polydipsia), fatigue, blurred vision, tingling or loss of feeling in the hands and feet (diabetic neuropathy), sores that do not heal well, and weight loss. If blood glucose levels are not controlled through medication or diet, type 2 diabetes can cause long-lasting (chronic) health problems including heart disease and stroke; nerve damage; and damage to the kidneys, eyes, and other parts of the body.",
      "sub_topic_2":"Frequency",
      "sub_topic_2_description":"Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes, accounting for 90 to 95 percent of all cases. In 2015, more than 23 million people in the United States had diagnosed diabetes and an additional 7 million people likely had undiagnosed diabetes. The prevalence of diabetes increases with age, and the disease currently affects more than 20 percent of Americans over age 65. It is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States.\n\nThe risk of diabetes varies by ethnic and geographic background. In the United States, the disease is most common in Native Americans and Alaska Natives. It also has a higher prevalence among people of African American or Hispanic ancestry than those of non-Hispanic white or Asian ancestry. Geographically, diabetes is most prevalent in the southern and Appalachian regions of the United States.\n\nThe prevalence of diabetes is rapidly increasing worldwide. Due to an increase in inactive (sedentary) lifestyles, obesity, and other risk factors, the frequency of this disease has more than quadrupled in the past 35 years.",
      "sub_topic_3":"Causes",
      "sub_topic_3_description":"The causes of type 2 diabetes are complex. This condition results from a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors, some of which have not been identified.\n\nStudies have identified at least 150 DNA variations that are associated with the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Most of these changes are common and are present both in people with diabetes and in those without. Each person has some variations that increase risk and others that reduce risk. It is the combination of these changes that helps determine a person's likelihood of developing the disease.\n\nThe majority of genetic variations associated with type 2 diabetes are thought to act by subtly changing the amount, timing, and location of gene activity (expression). These changes in expression affect genes involved in many aspects of type 2 diabetes, including the development and function of beta cells in the pancreas, the release and processing of insulin, and cells' sensitivity to the effects of insulin. However, for many of the variations that have been associated with type 2 diabetes, the mechanism by which they contribute to disease risk is unknown.\n\nGenetic variations likely act together with health and lifestyle factors to influence an individual's overall risk of type 2 diabetes. All of these factors are related, directly or indirectly, to the body's ability to produce and respond to insulin. Health conditions that predispose to the disease include overweight or obesity, insulin resistance, prediabetes (higher-than-normal blood glucose levels that do not reach the cutoff for diabetes), and a form of diabetes called gestational diabetes that occurs during pregnancy. Lifestyle factors including smoking, a poor diet, and physical inactivity also increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.",

When blood sugar levels are high over a long time, both nerve and blood vessel damage occurs in the arms and legs.\n\nNerve damage makes it harder to notice the amount of pressure on the foot or if it is being stressed. The result is ongoing small injuries to the bones and ligaments that support the foot.\n\nYou may develop bone stress fractures in your feet, yet never know it.\nContinuing to walk on the fractured bone often leads to further bone and joint damage.\nOther factors leading to foot damage include:\n\nBlood vessel damage from diabetes can increase or change blood flow to the feet. This can lead to bone loss. Weakened bones in the feet increase the risk of fracture.\nInjury to the foot signals the body to produce more inflammation-causing chemicals.

This occurs when the bones in middle of the foot collapse. This causes the arch of the foot to collapse and bow downward.\nThe toes may curl downward.\nBones that stick out at odd angles can lead to pressure sores and foot ulcers.\n\nBecause the feet are numb, these sores and ulcers may grow wider or deeper before they are noticed.\nHigh blood sugar also makes it hard for the body to fight infection.

To help manage your blood sugar, follow a meal plan that has:\n\nFood from all the food groups\nFewer calories\nAbout the same amount of carbohydrates at each meal and snack\nHealthy fats\nAlong with healthy eating, you can help keep your blood sugar in target range by maintaining a healthy weight. People with type 2 diabetes are often overweight or obese. Losing even 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) can help you manage your diabetes better. Eating healthy foods and staying active (for example, 60 total minutes of walking or other activity per day) can help you meet and maintain your weight loss goal. Activity lets your muscles use sugar from the blood without needing insulin to move the sugar into the muscle cells.\n\nHOW CARBOHYDRATES AFFECT BLOOD SUGAR\n\nCarbohydrates in food give your body energy. You need to eat carbohydrates to maintain your energy. But carbohydrates also raise your blood sugar higher and faster than other kinds of food.\n\nThe main kinds of carbohydrates are starches, sugars, and fiber. Learn which foods have carbohydrates. This will help with meal planning so that you can keep your blood sugar in your target range. Not all carbohydrates can be broken down and absorbed by your body. Foods with more non-digestible carbohydrates, or fiber, are less likely to increase your blood sugar out of your goal range. These include foods such as beans and whole grains.\n\nMEAL PLANNING FOR CHILDREN WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES\n\nMeal plans should consider the amount of calories children need to grow. In general, three small meals and three snacks a day can help meet calorie needs. Many children with type 2 diabetes are overweight. The goal should be able to reach a healthy weight by eating healthy foods and getting more activity (150 minutes in a week).\n\nWork with a registered dietitian to design a meal plan for your child. A registered dietitian is an expert in food and nutrition.\n\nThe following tips can help your child stay on track:\n\nNo food is off-limits. Knowing how different foods affect your child's blood sugar helps you and your child keep blood sugar in target range.\nHelp your child learn how much food is a healthy amount. This is called portion control.\nHave your family gradually switch from drinking soda and other sugary drinks, such as sports drinks and juices, to plain water or low-fat milk.\nPLANNING MEALS\n\nEveryone has individual needs. Work with your health care provider, registered dietitian, or diabetes educator to develop a meal plan that works for you.\n\nWhen shopping, read food labels to make better food choices.\n\nA good way to make sure you get all the nutrients you need during meals is to use the plate method. This is a visual food guide that helps you choose the best types and right amounts of food to eat. It encourages larger portions of non-starchy vegetables (half the plate) and moderate portions of protein (one quarter of the plate) and starch (one quarter of the plate).\n\nEAT A VARIETY OF FOODS\n\nEating a wide variety of foods helps you stay healthy. Try to include foods from all the food groups at each meal.\n\nVEGETABLES (2\u00bd to 3 cups or 450 to 550 grams a day)\n\nChoose fresh or frozen vegetables without added sauces, fats, or salt. Non-starchy vegetables include dark green and deep yellow vegetables, such as cucumber, spinach, broccoli, romaine lettuce, cabbage, chard, and bell peppers. Starchy vegetables include corn, green peas, lima beans, carrots, yams and taro. Note that potato should be considered a pure starch, like white bread or white rice, instead of a vegetable.\n\nFRUITS (1\u00bd to 2 cups or 240 to 320 grams a day)\n\nChoose fresh, frozen, canned (without added sugar or syrup), or unsweetened dried fruits. Try apples, bananas, berries, cherries, fruit cocktail, grapes, melon, oranges, peaches, pears, papaya, pineapple, and raisins. Drink juices that are 100% fruit with no added sweeteners or syrups.\n\nGRAINS (3 to 4 ounces or 85 to 115 grams a day)\n\nThere are 2 types of grains:\n\nWhole grains are unprocessed and have the entire grain kernel. Examples are whole-wheat flour, oatmeal, whole cornmeal, amaranth, barley, brown and wild rice, buckwheat, and quinoa.\nRefined grains have been processed (milled) to remove the bran and germ. Examples are white flour, de-germed cornmeal, white bread, and white rice.\nGrains have starch, a type of carbohydrate. Carbohydrates raise your blood sugar level. For healthy eating, make sure half of the grains you eat each day are whole grains. Whole grains have lots of fiber. Fiber in the diet keeps your blood sugar level from rising too fast.\n\nPROTEIN FOODS (5 to 6\u00bd ounces or 140 to 184 grams a day)\n\nProtein foods include meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, beans and peas, nuts, seeds, and processed soy foods. Eat fish and poultry more often. Remove the skin from chicken and turkey. Select lean cuts of beef, veal, pork, or wild game. Trim all visible fat from meat. Bake, roast, broil, grill, or boil instead of frying. When frying proteins, use healthy oils such as olive oil.\n\nDAIRY (3 cups or 245 grams a day)\n\nChoose low-fat dairy products. Be aware that milk, yogurt, and other dairy foods have natural sugar, even when they do not contain added sugar. Take this into account when planning meals to stay in your blood sugar target range. Some non-fat dairy products have a lot of added sugar. Be sure to read the label.\n\nOILS/FATS (no more than 7 teaspoons or 35 milliliters a day)\n\nOils are not considered a food group. But they have nutrients that help your body stay healthy. Oils are different from fats in that oils remain liquid at room temperature. Fats remain solid at room temperature.\n\nLimit your intake of fatty foods, especially those high in saturated fat, such as hamburgers, deep-fried foods, bacon, and butter.\n\nInstead, choose foods that are high in polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats. These include fish, nuts, and vegetable oils.\n\nOils can raise your blood sugar, but not as fast as starch. Oils are also high in calories. Try to use no more than the recommended daily limit of 7 teaspoons (35 milliliters).\n\nWHAT ABOUT ALCOHOL AND SWEETS?\n\nIf you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount and have it with a meal. Check with your health care provider about how alcohol will affect your blood sugar and to determine a safe amount for you.\n\nSweets are high in fat and sugar. Keep portion sizes small.\n\nHere are tips to help avoid eating too many sweets:\n\nAsk for extra spoons and forks and split your dessert with others.\nEat sweets that are sugar-free.\nAlways ask for the smallest serving size or children's size.\nYOUR DIABETES CARE TEAM IS THERE TO HELP YOU\n\nIn the beginning, meal planning may be overwhelming. But it will become easier as your knowledge grows about foods and their effects on your blood sugar. If you're having problems with meal planning, talk with your diabetes care team. They are there to help you.\n",

      "sub_heading_1_description":"At first, the goal of treatment is to lower your high blood glucose level. Long-term goals are to prevent complications. These are health problems that can result from having diabetes.\n\nThe most important lifestyle approach to treating and managing type 2 diabetes is by being active and eating healthy foods.\n\nEveryone with diabetes should receive proper education and support about the best ways to manage their diabetes. Ask your provider about seeing a certified diabetes care and education specialist (CDCES) and a dietitian.\n\nLEARN THESE SKILLS\n\nLearning diabetes management skills will help you live well with diabetes. These skills help prevent health problems and the need for medical care. Skills include:\n\nHow to test and record your blood glucose\nWhat, when, and how much to eat\nHow to safely increase your activity and control your weight\nHow to take medicines, if needed\nHow to recognize and treat low and high blood sugar\nHow to handle sick days\nWhere to buy diabetes supplies and how to store them\nIt may take several months to learn these skills. Keep learning about diabetes, its complications, and how to control and live well with the disease. Stay up-to-date on new research and treatments. Make sure you are getting information from trustworthy sources, such as your provider and diabetes educator.\n\nMANAGING YOUR BLOOD SUGAR\n\nChecking your blood sugar level yourself and writing down the results tells you how well you are managing your diabetes. Talk to your provider and diabetes educator about how often to check.\n\nTo check your blood sugar level, you use a device called a glucose meter. Usually, you prick your finger with a small needle, called a lancet. This gives you a tiny drop of blood. You place the blood on a test strip and put the strip into the meter. The meter gives you a reading that tells you the level of your blood sugar.\n\nYour provider or diabetes educator will help set up a testing schedule for you. Your provider will help you set a target range for your blood sugar numbers. Keep these factors in mind:\n\nMost people with type 2 diabetes only need to check their blood sugar once or twice a day.\nIf your blood sugar level is under control, you may only need to check it a few times a week.\nYou may test yourself when you wake up, before meals, and at bedtime.\nYou may need to test more often when you are sick or under stress.\nYou may need to test more often if you are having more frequent low blood sugar symptoms.\nKeep a record of your blood sugar for yourself and your provider. This can often be done most easily using a website designed for this purpose. Based on your numbers, you may need to make changes to your meals, activity, or medicines to keep your blood sugar level in the right range. Always bring your blood glucose meter to medical appointments so the data can be downloaded and discussed.\n\nYour provider may recommend that you use a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) to measure blood sugar if:\n\nYou are using insulin injections many times a day\nYou have had an episode of severe low blood sugar\nYour blood sugar level varies a lot\nThe CGM has a sensor that is inserted just under the skin to measure glucose in your tissue fluid every 5 minutes.\n\nHEALTHY EATING AND WEIGHT CONTROL\n\nWork closely with your health care providers to learn how much fat, protein, and carbohydrates you need in your diet. Your meal plans should fit your lifestyle and habits and should include foods that you like.\n\nManaging your weight and having a well-balanced diet are important. Some people with type 2 diabetes can stop taking medicines after losing weight. This does not mean that their diabetes is cured. They still have diabetes.\n\nObese people whose diabetes is not well managed with diet and medicine may consider weight loss (bariatric) surgery.\n\nREGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY\n\nRegular activity is important for everyone. It is even more important when you have diabetes. Exercise is good for your health because it:\n\nLowers your blood sugar level without medicine\nBurns extra calories and fat to help manage your weight\nImproves blood flow and blood pressure\nIncreases your energy level\nImproves your ability to handle stress\nTalk to your provider before starting any exercise program. People with type 2 diabetes may need to take special steps before, during, and after physical activity or exercise, including adjusting doses of insulin if needed.\n\nDiabetes and exercise\nMEDICINES TO TREAT DIABETES\n\nIf diet and exercise do not help keep your blood sugar at normal or near-normal levels, your provider may prescribe medicine. Since these medicines help lower your blood sugar level in different ways, your provider may have you take more than one medicine.\n\nSome of the most common types of medicines are listed below. They are taken by mouth or injection.\n\nAlpha-glucosidase inhibitors\nBiguanides\nBile acid sequestrants\nDPP-4 inhibitors\nInjectable medicines (GLP-1 agonists)\nMeglitinides\nSGLT2 inhibitors\nSulfonylureas\nThiazolidinediones\nYou may need to take insulin if your blood sugar cannot be controlled with some of the above medicines. Most commonly, insulin is injected under the skin using a syringe, insulin pen, or pump. Another form of insulin is the inhaled type. Insulin cannot be taken by mouth because the acid in the stomach destroys the insulin.\n\nPREVENTING COMPLICATIONS\n\nYour provider may prescribe medicines or other treatments to reduce your chance of developing some of the more common complications of diabetes, including:\n\nEye disease\nKidney disease\nHeart disease and stroke\nFOOT CARE\n\nPeople with diabetes are more likely than those without diabetes to have foot problems. Diabetes damages the nerves. This can make your feet less able to feel pressure, pain, heat, or cold. You may not notice a foot injury until you have severe damage to the skin and tissue below, or you get a severe infection.\n\nDiabetes can also damage blood vessels. Small sores or breaks in the skin may become deeper skin sores (ulcers). The affected limb may need to be amputated if these skin ulcers do not heal or become larger, deeper, or infected.\n\nTo prevent problems with your feet:\n\nStop using tobacco, if you use it.\nImprove control of your blood sugar.\nGet a foot exam by your provider at least twice a year to learn if you have nerve damage.\nAsk your provider to check your feet for problems such as calluses, bunions or hammertoes. These need to be treated to prevent skin breakdown and ulcers.\nCheck and care for your feet every day. This is very important when you already have nerve or blood vessel damage or foot problems.\nTreat minor infections, such as athlete's foot, right away.\nUse moisturizing lotion on dry skin.\nMake sure you wear the right kind of shoes. Ask your provider what type of shoe is right for you.\nDiabetic foot care\nEMOTIONAL HEALTH\n\nLiving with diabetes can be stressful. You may feel overwhelmed by everything you need to do to manage your diabetes. But taking care of your emotional health is just as important as your physical health.\n\nWays to relieve stress include:\n\nListening to relaxing music\nMeditating to take your mind off your worries\nDeep breathing to help relieve physical tension\nDoing yoga, tai chi, or progressive relaxation\nFeeling sad or down (depressed) or anxious sometimes is normal. But if you have these feelings often and they're getting in the way of managing your diabetes, talk with your health care team. They can find ways to help you feel better.\n\nPeople with diabetes should make sure to keep up on their vaccination schedule.",

      "sub_topic_1_description":"Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas by special cells, called beta cells. The pancreas is below and behind the stomach. Insulin is needed to move blood sugar (glucose) into cells. Inside the cells, glucose is stored and later used for energy.\n\nPancreas\nWhen you have type 2 diabetes, your fat, liver, and muscle cells do not respond correctly to insulin. This is called insulin resistance. As a result, glucose does not get into these cells to be stored for energy.\n\nWhen sugar cannot enter cells, a high level of sugar builds up in the blood. This is called hyperglycemia. The body is unable to use the glucose for energy. This leads to the symptoms of type 2 diabetes.\n\nType 2 diabetes usually develops slowly over time. Most people with the disease are overweight or obese when they are diagnosed. Increased fat makes it harder for your body to use insulin the correct way.\n\nType 2 diabetes can also develop in people who are not overweight or obese. This is more common in older adults.\n\nFamily history and genes play a role in type 2 diabetes.

Simple blood tests can diagnose T2D.",
      "sub_heading_3":"What causes Type 2 diabetes?",
      "sub_heading_3_description":"The main cause of Type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance.\n\nInsulin resistance happens when cells in your muscles, fat and liver don\u2019t respond as they should to insulin. Insulin is a hormone your pancreas makes that\u2019s essential for life and regulating blood sugar levels.\n\nIf your body isn\u2019t responding to insulin properly, your pancreas has to make more insulin to try to overcome your increasing blood glucose levels (hyperinsulinemia). If your cells become too resistant to insulin and your pancreas can\u2019t make enough insulin to overcome it, it leads to Type 2 diabetes.\n\nSeveral factors can contribute to insulin resistance, including:\n\nGenetics.\nExcess body fat, especially in your belly and around your organs (visceral fat).\nPhysical inactivity.\nEating highly processed, high-carbohydrate foods and saturated fats frequently.\nCertain medications, like long-term corticosteroid use.\nHormonal disorders, like hypothyroidism and Cushing syndrome.\nChronic stress and a lack of quality sleep.",
      "sub_heading_4":"Is Type 2 diabetes genetic?",
      "sub_heading_4_description":"The cause of T2D is complex, but researchers know that genetics play a strong role. Your lifetime risk of developing T2D is 40% if you have one biological parent with T2D and 70% if both of your biological parents have it.\n\nResearchers have identified at least 150 DNA variations linked to the risk of developing T2D \u2014 some increase your risk and others decrease it. Some of these variations may directly play a role in insulin resistance and insulin production. Others may increase your risk of T2D by increasing your tendency to have overweight or obesity.\n\nThese genetic variations likely act together with health and lifestyle factors to influence your overall risk of T2D.",

If you or your child has symptoms of Type 1 diabetes, your healthcare provider will order the following tests:\n\nBlood glucose test: Your healthcare provider uses a blood glucose test to check the amount of sugar in your blood. They may ask you to do a random test (without fasting) and a fasting test (no food or drink for at least eight hours before the test). If the result shows that you have very high blood sugar, it typically means you have Type 1 diabetes.\nGlycosylated hemoglobin test (A1c): If blood glucose test results indicate that you have diabetes, your healthcare provider may do an A1c test. This measures your average blood sugar levels over three months.\nAntibody test: This blood test checks for autoantibodies to determine if you have Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. Autoantibodies are proteins that attack your body\u2019s tissue by mistake. The presence of certain autoantibodies means you have Type 1 diabetes. Autoantibodies usually aren\u2019t present in people who have Type 2 diabetes.\nYour provider will also likely order the following tests to assess your overall health and to check if you have diabetes-related ketoacidosis, a serious acute complication of undiagnosed or untreated Type 1 diabetes:\n\nBasic metabolic panel: This is a blood sample test that measures eight different substances in your blood. The panel provides helpful information about your body's chemical balance and metabolism.\nUrinalysis: A urinalysis (also known as a urine test) is a test that examines the visual, chemical and microscopic aspects of your urine (pee). Providers use it to measure several different aspects of your urine. In the case of a Type 1 diagnosis, they\u2019ll likely order the test to check for ketones, which is a substance your body releases when it has to break down fat for energy instead of using glucose. A high amount of ketones causes your blood to become acidic, which can be life-threatening.\nArterial blood gas: An arterial blood gas (ABG) test is a blood test that requires a sample from an artery in your body to measure the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood.",

This is the most common type of diabetes. It mainly affects adults, but children can have it as well.\nPrediabetes: This type is the stage before Type 2 diabetes. Your blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be officially diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes.\nType 1 diabetes: This type is an autoimmune disease in which your immune system attacks and destroys insulin-producing cells in your pancreas for unknown reasons. Up to 10% of people who have diabetes have Type 1. It\u2019s usually diagnosed in children and young adults, but it can develop at any age.\nGestational diabetes: This type develops in some people during pregnancy. Gestational diabetes usually goes away after pregnancy. However, if you have gestational diabetes, you\u2019re at a higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes later in life.\nOther types of diabetes include:\n\nType 3c diabetes: This form of diabetes happens when your pancreas experiences damage (other than autoimmune damage), which affects its ability to produce insulin. Pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, cystic fibrosis and hemochromatosis can all lead to pancreas damage that causes diabetes. Having your pancreas removed (pancreatectomy) also results in Type 3c.\nLatent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA): Like Type 1 diabetes, LADA also results from an autoimmune reaction, but it develops much more slowly than Type 1. People diagnosed with LADA are usually over the age of 30.\nMaturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY): MODY, also called monogenic diabetes, happens due to an inherited genetic mutation that affects how your body makes and uses insulin. There are currently over 10 different types of MODY. It affects up to 5% of people with diabetes and commonly runs in families.\nNeonatal diabetes: This is a rare form of diabetes that occurs within the first six months of life. It\u2019s also a form of monogenic diabetes. About 50% of babies with neonatal diabetes have the lifelong form called permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus. For the other half, the condition disappears within a few months from onset, but it can come back later in life. This is called transient neonatal diabetes mellitus.\nBrittle diabetes: Brittle diabetes is a form of Type 1 diabetes that\u2019s marked by frequent and severe episodes of high and low blood sugar levels.

      "sub_topic_3_description":"All oral diabetes medications share one goal: To help lower blood glucose levels (and your A1c) to a healthy range.\n\nA significant contributor to the development of Type 2 diabetes (and gestational diabetes) is insulin resistance.\n\nInsulin resistance, also known as impaired insulin sensitivity, happens when cells in your muscles, fat and liver don\u2019t respond as they should to insulin. Insulin is a hormone your pancreas makes. It allows your body to turn the glucose (sugar) you consume from food into energy. This is an essential, life-sustaining process.\n\nAs a result of insulin resistance, your pancreas has to release more insulin to try to keep your blood sugar levels in a healthy range. If your pancreas can\u2019t release enough insulin, your blood sugar levels rise, causing hyperglycemia (high blood sugar). Long-term hyperglycemia can cause several health issues.\n\nInsulin resistance is a complex phenomenon. Oral diabetes medications work in different ways to lower blood sugar, including helping your pancreas produce more insulin. Beyond medication, exercise is a key part of naturally reducing insulin resistance.",

Hypoglycemia can develop if things like food, exercise and diabetes medications are out of balance.\n\nCommon situations that can lead to hypoglycemia for people with diabetes include:\n\nTaking too much insulin, the wrong insulin or injecting it into your muscle instead of in your fat tissue.\nNot timing insulin and carb intake correctly (for example, waiting too long to eat a meal after taking insulin for the meal).\nTaking too much or too high of a dose of oral diabetes medications.\nBeing more active than usual.\nDrinking alcohol without eating.\nEating meals later than usual or skipping meals.\nNot balancing meals by including fat, protein and fiber.\nPeople who are pregnant and have Type 1 diabetes are also more likely to experience low blood sugar during the first trimester due to hormone changes.\n",
      "sub_heading_7":"What causes hypoglycemia in people without diabetes?",
      "sub_heading_7_description":"There are two main types of non-diabetes-related hypoglycemia: reactive hypoglycemia and fasting hypoglycemia.\n\nReactive hypoglycemia\nReactive hypoglycemia happens when you experience low blood sugar after a meal. It typically occurs about two to four hours after a meal.\n\nResearchers don\u2019t yet know the exact cause. But they think it happens due to a sudden spike and then fall in blood sugar after eating certain foods, especially simple carbohydrate foods like white rice, potatoes, white bread, cake and pastries.\n\nBariatric surgery can also result in reactive hypoglycemia. After certain types of bariatric surgery, such as gastric bypass surgery, your body absorbs sugars very quickly, which stimulates excess insulin production. This can then cause hypoglycemia.\n\nYour body usually corrects reactive hypoglycemia on its own, but consuming carbohydrates may help your symptoms go away more quickly.\n\nFasting hypoglycemia\nFor the majority of people without diabetes, not eating food for a long time (fasting) doesn\u2019t lead to hypoglycemia. This is because your body uses hormones and stored glucose to manage your blood sugar.\n\nHowever, certain conditions and situations can lead to fasting hypoglycemia in people without diabetes, including:\n\nExcessive alcohol consumption: Alcohol prevents your body from forming new glucose cells (gluconeogenesis). If you drink excessive amounts of alcohol over several days and don\u2019t eat much, your body can run out of stored glucose (glycogen). This can lead to hypoglycemia because your body can\u2019t properly regulate your blood sugar.\nCritical illness: You can experience hypoglycemia in critical illness states, such as end-stage liver disease, sepsis, starvation or kidney failure. This is because your body is using stored glucose for energy faster than your body can create new glucose cells from the food you eat.\nAdrenal insufficiency: Adrenal insufficiency causes lower-than-normal cortisol levels. As cortisol (a hormone) helps regulate your blood sugar by increasing it, having low levels of cortisol can lead to hypoglycemia episodes.\nNon-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia (NICTH): This is a rare but serious syndrome in which a tumor releases excess insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2). This is a hormone that has similar effects as insulin. Excess IGF-2 causes hypoglycemia. A wide variety of benign (noncancerous) and malignant (cancerous) tumors can cause NICTH.\nInsulinoma: An insulinoma is a rare tumor in your pancreas that produces excess insulin. It leads to hypoglycemia episodes \u2014 most commonly in the early morning.\nIn rare cases, non-diabetes-related medications can lead to hypoglycemia, such as beta-blockers and certain antibiotics.\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing hypoglycemia and don\u2019t have diabetes, talk to your healthcare provider.",

Other hormonal and metabolic issues can also lead to low blood sugar.\n\nIf your blood sugar drops below the healthy range, it causes certain symptoms like shakiness and a faster heartbeat and can be life-threatening if it goes too low. This is because your brain needs a continuous supply of glucose to function properly. Without enough glucose, your brain can\u2019t function.\n",

      "sub_topic_1":"Causes",
      "sub_topic_1_description":"Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both.\n\nTo understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested and absorbed:\n\nA sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body.\nAn organ called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and other cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel.\nFood and insulin release\nPeople with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and/or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either:\n\nTheir pancreas does not make enough insulin\nTheir cells do not respond to insulin normally (also called insulin resistance)\nBoth of the above\nThere are two major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type:\n\nType I diabetes\nType 1 diabetes is less common. It can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin are damaged by an immune process and stop working. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause of the immune process is unknown.\nType 2 diabetes is more common. It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease. Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it. With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesn't use insulin as well as it should. Not all people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese.\nThere are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2. Examples include LADA (latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, a variant of type 1 diabetes), MODY (maturity-onset diabetes of the young), and diabetes due to other illnesses.\nGestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not already have diabetes.\n\nIf your parent, brother, or sister has diabetes, you are more likely to develop the disease.\n",
      "sub_topic_2":"Symptoms",
      "sub_topic_2_description":"A high blood sugar level can cause several symptoms, including:\n\nBlurry vision\nExcess thirst\nFatigue\nFrequent urination\nHunger\nWeight loss\nBecause type 2 diabetes develops slowly, some people with high blood sugar have no symptoms.\n\nSymptoms of type 1 diabetes typically develop over a short period. People may be very sick by the time they are diagnosed.\n\nAfter many years, diabetes can lead to other serious problems. These problems are known as diabetes complications, and include:\n\nEye problems, including trouble seeing (especially at night), light sensitivity, cataracts, and blindness\nSores and infections of the leg or foot, which if untreated, can lead to amputation of the leg or foot\nDamage to nerves in the body, causing pain, tingling, a loss of feeling, problems digesting food, and erectile dysfunction\nKidney problems, which can lead to kidney failure\nWeakened immune system, which can lead to more frequent infections\nIncreased chance of having a heart attack or stroke",
      "sub_topic_3":"Exams and Tests",
      "sub_topic_3_description":"A urine analysis may show high urine sugar. But a urine test alone does not diagnose diabetes.\n\nYour health care provider may suspect that you have diabetes if your blood sugar level is 200 mg/dL or higher (11.1 mmol/L). To confirm the diagnosis, one or more of the following tests must be done.\n\nBlood tests:\n\nFasting blood glucose level. Diabetes is diagnosed if the fasting glucose level is 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) or higher on two different tests, when the person is in their usual state of health. Levels between 100 and 125 mg/dL (5.5 and 7.0 mmol/L) are called impaired fasting glucose or prediabetes. These levels are risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes.\nHemoglobin A1C (A1C) test. Normal is less than 5.7%; prediabetes is 5.7% to 6.4%; and diabetes is 6.5% or higher.\nOral glucose tolerance test. Diabetes is diagnosed if the glucose level is 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher 2 hours after drinking a special 75 gram sugar drink (this test is used most often for type 2 diabetes and is rarely needed for type 1 diabetes).\nScreening for type 2 diabetes in people who have no symptoms is recommended for:\n\nOverweight children who have other risk factors for diabetes, starting at age 10 and repeated every 3 years\nOverweight or obese adults (BMI of 25 kilograms per square meter or higher) starting at age 35 repeated every 3 years\nOverweight women who have other risk factors such as high blood pressure who are planning to become pregnant\nAll adults age 35 or older, repeated every 3 years or at a younger age if the person has risk factors such as high blood pressure, or having a mother, father, sister, or brother with diabetes",

      "sub_topic_4_description":"Keeping an ideal body weight and an active lifestyle may prevent or delay the start of type 2 diabetes. If you're overweight, losing just 5% of your body weight can reduce your risk. Some medicines can also be used to delay or prevent the start of type 2 diabetes.\n\nAt this time, type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented. But there is promising research that shows type 1 diabetes may be delayed in some high risk people.",

But it\u2019s a lot more than that. This lifelong health condition continues far beyond the child-bearing years.\n\nWomen with PCOS are often insulin resistant; their bodies can make insulin but can\u2019t use it effectively, increasing their risk for type 2 diabetes. They also have higher levels of androgens (male hormones that females also have), which can stop eggs from being released (ovulation) and cause irregular periods, acne, thinning scalp hair, and excess hair growth on the face and body.\n\nWomen with PCOS can develop serious health problems, especially if they are overweight:\n\nDiabetes\u2014more than half of women with PCOS develop type 2 diabetes by age 40\nGestational diabetes (diabetes when pregnant)\u2014which puts the pregnancy and baby at risk and can lead to type 2 diabetes later in life for both mother and child\nHeart disease\u2014women with PCOS are at higher risk, and risk increases with age\nHigh blood pressure\u2014which can damage the heart, brain, and kidneys\nHigh LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol and low HDL (\u201cgood\u201d) cholesterol\u2014increasing the risk for heart disease\nSleep apnea\u2014a disorder that causes breathing to stop during sleep and raises the risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes\nStroke\u2014plaque (cholesterol and white blood cells) clogging blood vessels can lead to blood clots that in turn can cause a stroke\nPCOS is also linked to depression and anxiety, though the connection is not fully understood.\n",

The relationship is complicated and not well understood. Being overweight is associated with PCOS, but many women of normal weight have PCOS, and many overweight women don\u2019t.\n\nFamily History\u2026\n\nWomen whose mother or sister has PCOS or type 2 diabetes are more likely to develop PCOS.\n\n\u2026and Insulin Resistance\n\nLifestyle can have a big impact on insulin resistance, especially if a woman is overweight because of an unhealthy diet and lack of physical activity.

Some women will have just one symptom; others will have them all. Women of every race and ethnicity can have PCOS.\n\nIt\u2019s common for women to find out they have PCOS when they have trouble getting pregnant, but it often begins soon after the first menstrual period, as young as age 11 or 12. It can also develop in the 20s or 30s.\n\nTo determine if you have PCOS, your doctor will check that you have at least 2 of these 3 symptoms:\n\nIrregular periods or no periods, caused from lack of ovulation\nHigher than normal levels of male hormones that may result in excess hair on the face and body, acne, or thinning scalp hair\nMultiple small cysts on the ovaries\nJust having ovarian cysts isn\u2019t enough for a diagnosis.

That includes eating healthy food, being physically active most days, taking medicine if needed, and getting regular checkups.\n\nDiabetes is challenging for anyone to manage, but you may have additional barriers, including:\n\nCommunication: If you can\u2019t communicate fully with your doctors or they don\u2019t understand your values and preferences, you\u2019re less likely to follow treatment instructions and make lifestyle changes.\nCulture: You may put the needs of your family before your own health needs. You may want to use natural or traditional medicines instead of standard diabetes treatments. You may also have heard that taking insulin will cause diabetes complications (this isn\u2019t true).\nFor help dealing with daily diabetes care, ask your doctor for a referral to diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES) services. DSMES has many benefits, from helping improve blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels to enhancing quality of life.\n\nHelp could also be as close as the dinner table. Hispanic or Latino people are known for their strong family connections, and for sharing meals together at home. When a family member has to change what he or she eats to manage diabetes, it affects the whole family. This can be an opportunity for everyone to make healthy changes, which is especially important for kids. Hispanic or Latino children and teens are at higher risk for type 2 diabetes too, and learning healthy eating habits early gives them the best chance to prevent it.",
      "sub_topic_3":"Prediabetes",

With prediabetes, blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough yet to be diagnosed as type 2 diabetes. If you have prediabetes, you\u2019re at higher risk for getting type 2 diabetes and other serious health problems, including heart disease and stroke.\n\nPrediabetes usually doesn\u2019t have any symptoms, so finding out your risk by taking the 1-minute prediabetes risk test (available in Spanish and English) is an important first step, especially if you have other prediabetes risk factors. If you get a high score (5 or above), visit your doctor and get a simple blood sugar test to confirm your result.\n\nIf you have prediabetes, joining a lifestyle change program offered as part of CDC\u2019s National Diabetes Prevention Program (National DPP) can help you prevent or delay type 2 diabetes and improve your overall health. You\u2019ll learn the skills needed to lose a modest amount of weight through healthy eating and being more physically active. (Classes are available in Spanish and English.)\n\nA modest amount of weight loss is about 10 to 14 pounds (4.5 to 6.3 kg) for a 200-pound (90.6 kg) person. Getting at least 150 minutes of physical activity a week, such as brisk walking, also is important. That\u2019s just 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week.\n\nIn the lifestyle change program, you\u2019ll work with a trained coach and share experiences with others who have the same goals and challenges.

      "sub_topic_1":"Erectile Dysfunction (ED)",
      "sub_topic_1_description":"With ED, a man can\u2019t get or keep an erection firm enough for sex. ED is common in middle-aged and older men \u2013 as many as 30 million in the United States have it. Men with diabetes are three times more likely to have ED. Getting older doesn\u2019t cause ED, but it does increase your chance of getting it.\n\nFirst, some facts. Here\u2019s what ED isn\u2019t:\n\nOccasional trouble having an erection. That really does happen to everyone.\nLess interest in sex. ED happens when a man wants to have sex but can\u2019t have or keep an erection.\nProblems with ejaculation, which can mean a structural problem with the penis.\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to have trouble getting an erection sometimes, but if it gets worse, happens often, or prevents you from living the life you want, it\u2019s time to get it checked out.\n\nMen who have diabetes are more likely to have heart disease, and ED can be a warning sign of blood vessel problems. If you have both, talk to your doctor about treatment. Some ED medicines are not safe to take with certain heart medicines, though, so make sure you let your doctor know about any medicines you\u2019re taking.\n",
      "sub_topic_2":"Causes of ED",
      "sub_topic_2_description":"Damage from high blood sugar or high blood pressure to nerves and blood vessels needed to have an erection\nSome medicines for high blood pressure, depression, or allergies (don\u2019t stop taking them, but do talk with your doctor to see if you can take a different medicine or lower the dose)\nTreatment for prostate cancer or an enlarged prostate\nSurgery that affects the pelvic area or spinal cord\nUsing tobacco or alcohol\nSleep disorders\nIt\u2019s important to visit your doctor to find out if any of these causes are contributing to ED.",
      "sub_topic_3":"ED Treatment",
      "sub_topic_3_description":"It can be tough to talk about ED, but it\u2019s a conversation you need to have with your doctor so you can get treated. The good news is more than 95% of men \u2013 you and almost all of the other guys in the waiting room with you \u2013 can be treated successfully.\n\nMedicine: If you have normal nerve function, you could take a type of medicine that increases blood flow to the penis. Sometimes these medicines don\u2019t work well for guys with diabetes and should NOT be taken if you\u2019re also taking nitrates for your heart. Be sure to check with your doctor about any possible medicine interactions.\nTestosterone: Sometimes having low testosterone (low T) can cause ED. Men with diabetes are twice as likely to have low T than men who don\u2019t have diabetes. Taking testosterone may help you have normal erections or help ED medicine work better. It can also make low blood sugar worse and increase blood pressure, so make sure to get regular checkups to spot and manage any problems.\nVacuum device: This is a plastic tube that fits over the penis, creating a low-pressure vacuum that causes an erection. An elastic ring is slipped onto the base of the penis to hold blood in and maintain the erection. With training, about 75% of men can get an erection firm enough for sex.\nInjection or suppository: For an immediate erection just before sex, you can inject a medicine into the side of the penis with a very small needle, or place a tiny pill in the urethra (the tube urine comes out of).\nImplant: A penile implant placed inside the penis by surgery is often recommended if other treatments don\u2019t work. However, if you\u2019re having trouble managing your blood sugar, your chance for infection after surgery is higher and your doctor may advise against an implant.\nSometimes treatment for ED can cause a long-lasting erection. If yours lasts more than two to four hours, go to your doctor or the emergency room right away. This very painful condition can lead to permanent damage if not treated immediately.\n",

      "sub_topic_1_description":"Gestational diabetes occurs when your body can\u2019t make enough insulin during your pregnancy. Insulin is a hormone made by your pancreas that acts like a key to let blood sugar into the cells in your body for use as energy.\n\nDuring pregnancy, your body makes more hormones and goes through other changes, such as weight gain. These changes cause your body\u2019s cells to use insulin less effectively, a condition called insulin resistance. Insulin resistance increases your body\u2019s need for insulin.\n\nAll pregnant women have some insulin resistance during late pregnancy. However, some women have insulin resistance even before they get pregnant. They start pregnancy with an increased need for insulin and are more likely to have gestational diabetes.",

      "sub_topic_3_description":"Having gestational diabetes can increase your risk of high blood pressure during pregnancy. It can also increase your risk of having a large baby that needs to be delivered by cesarean section (C-section).\n\nIf you have gestational diabetes, your baby is at higher risk of:\n\nBeing very large (9 pounds or more), which can make delivery more difficult\nBeing born early, which can cause breathing and other problems\nHaving low blood sugar\nDeveloping type 2 diabetes later in life\nYour blood sugar levels will usually return to normal after your baby is born. However, about 50% of women with gestational diabetes go on to develop type 2 diabetes. You can lower your risk by reaching a healthy body weight after delivery. Visit your doctor to have your blood sugar tested 6 to 12 weeks after your baby is born and then every 1 to 3 years to make sure your levels are on target.\n",

This vital hormone\u2014you can\u2019t survive without it\u2014regulates blood sugar (glucose) in the body, a very complicated process. Here are the high points:\n\nThe food you eat is broken down into blood sugar.\nBlood sugar enters your bloodstream, which signals the pancreas to release insulin.\nInsulin helps blood sugar enter the body\u2019s cells so it can be used for energy.\nInsulin also signals the liver to store blood sugar for later use.\nBlood sugar enters cells, and levels in the bloodstream decrease, signaling insulin to decrease too.\nLower insulin levels alert the liver to release stored blood sugar so energy is always available, even if you haven\u2019t eaten for a while.\nThat\u2019s when everything works smoothly. But this finely tuned system can quickly get out of whack, as follows:\n\nA lot of blood sugar enters the bloodstream.\nThe pancreas pumps out more insulin to get blood sugar into cells.\nOver time, cells stop responding to all that insulin\u2014they\u2019ve become insulin resistant.\nThe pancreas keeps making more insulin to try to make cells respond.\nEventually, the pancreas can\u2019t keep up, and blood sugar keeps rising.\nLots of blood sugar in the bloodstream is very damaging to the body and needs to be moved into cells as soon as possible. There\u2019s lots of insulin, too, telling the liver and muscles to store blood sugar. When they\u2019re full, the liver sends the excess blood sugar to fat cells to be stored as body fat. Yep, weight gain. And what\u2019s more serious, the stage is set for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.",

      "sub_heading_2_description":"The development of type 2 diabetes is thought to be a progression from normal blood sugars to pre-diabetes to a diagnosis of overt diabetes. These stages are defined by blood sugar levels.\n\nThe timeline to developing an elevated blood sugar depends on many environmental factors (such as being overweight, physical activity, age, diet, illness, pregnancy, and medication) and also on how strong the gene traits are for diabetes. Ultimately, pre-diabetes and diabetes occur when the pancreas cannot make enough insulin to overcome the insulin resistance. Historically pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes has been diagnosed when individuals are older; however, because of a wide-spread epidemic of obesity which causes insulin resistance, the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is occurring more frequently at younger and younger ages.\n\nPeople born with the genetic traits for diabetes are considered to be pre-disposed. Genetically predisposed people may have normal blood sugar levels, but many will have other markers of insulin resistance such, as elevated triglycerides and hypertension. When environmental factors are introduced, such as weight gain, lack of physical activity, or pregnancy, they are likely to develop diabetes.\n\nSome individuals with other types of diabetes may be misdiagnosed as having type 2 diabetes. Up to 10% of individuals who are initially diagnosed with type 2 diabetes may actually have an adult onset of type 1 diabetes also known as LADA or Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adults.",
      "sub_heading_3":"Pre-diabetes",
      "sub_heading_3_description":"Pre-diabetes is a stage between not having diabetes and having type 2 diabetes. You have pre-diabetes when your blood sugars are above normal, but not so high as to meet the diagnostic criteria for type 2 diabetes. One in three people with pre-diabetes will go on to develop type 2 diabetes; however, with the correct lifestyle changes, including exercise, weight loss, a healthy diet, and the correct medications, the odds decrease so that only one in nine pre-diabetic people develop type 2 diabetes. In some cases, your blood sugar levels can return to normal. However, even if blood sugar levels return to normal, the genetic risk for type 2 diabetes remains unchanged \u2013 you must continue positive lifestyle changes, and medication or risk the return of elevated blood sugar levels.",

      "sub_topic_3":"Insulin resistance and insufficient insulin production",
      "sub_topic_3_description":"Insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes means the signal insulin gives to a cell is weakened. This results in less glucose uptake by muscle and fat cells and a reduction in insulin mediated activities inside cells. Compounding this problem of resistance, there is additional defect in insulin production and secretion by the insulin producing cells, the beta cells in the pancreas.\n\nAs a group, everyone with with type 2 diabetes has both insulin resistance and an inability to overcome the resistance by secreting more insulin. But any given individual with type 2 may have more resistance than insulin insufficiency or the opposite, more insulin insufficiency than resistance. And the problems may be mild or severe. It is believed that the wide range of clinical presentation is because there are many, many genetic causes \u2013 and combinations of genetic causes \u2013 of type 2 diabetes. At present there is no single genetic test for type 2 diabetes. The diagnosis is made on the basis of the individual having clinical features consistent with type 2 diabetes, and by excluding other forms of diabetes.",

      "description":"Gestational diabetes refers to diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy. The Center for Disease control estimates that up to 9.2% of pregnant women will develop gestational diabetes. Pregnancy hormones can interfere with the way insulin works in the mother\u2019s body which can lead to elevated blood glucose levels during pregnancy. Women are typically screened for gestational diabetes at 24-28 weeks of pregnancy, however women who have risk factors may be screened earlier. Risk factors for developing gestational diabetes include having a family history of diabetes, being overweight, or over 25 years old. Women who are black, Hispanic, American Indian or Asian are more likely to develop gestational diabetes. Blood glucose control during pregnancy is critical as elevated maternal glucose levels can lead to pregnancy complications and poses risks to the health of the baby. Gestational diabetes is likely to recur during subsequent pregnancies.\n\nGestational diabetes requires specialized treatment for the rest of the pregnancy. After the pregnancy is over, most women will have normal blood sugars again; however, up to 20-50 % will develop type 2 diabetes within 10 years. Regular screening is recommended. The best prevention strategy is to eat healthy, control weight, and stay active.",

      "sub_heading_1_description":"Insulin needs to be injected to work properly. It is usually injected into the fatty tissue of your abdomen, thighs or buttocks.\n\nThere are a few different types of delivery devices available to inject insulin. For more information, read the healthdirect page on insulin devices.\n\nYour doctor or diabetes nurse or educator will advise you about how to take insulin using your device. It is important that you always follow this advice exactly.\n\nContact your diabetes nurse or educator if you:\n\nhave forgotten or missed a dose of insulin\nare late taking your insulin\nhave not taken enough insulin",
      "sub_heading_2":"What should I do if I take too much insulin?",
      "sub_heading_2_description":"Taking too much insulin or other diabetes medicines can cause your blood sugar level to drop too low. This is known as hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) or a \u2018hypo\u2019. Hypoglycaemia can develop into a serious situation if not addressed. If you think you have taken too much insulin, check your blood glucose level as soon as possible, and repeat this frequently.\n\nIf your blood glucose level is low, you will need to address this straight away \u2014 read the healthdirect page on hypoglycaemia for how to do this.\n",
      "sub_heading_3":"What should I do if I take too little insulin?",
      "sub_heading_3_description":"Taking too little insulin can cause your blood glucose level to rise too high. This is called hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar).\n\nIf you have forgotten or missed a dose of insulin, or have not taken enough insulin:\n\nDo not take the missed dose or extra insulin unless your diabetes nurse or educator or doctor advises you to do so.\nDrink plenty of sugar-free, non-alcoholic fluids such as water to stay well hydrated. Avoid alcohol and drinks containing caffeine, such as cola, tea and coffee because these can dehydrate you.\nContinue to monitor your blood glucose level regularly.\nIf you find your blood glucose level stays high, you will need to address this \u2014 see the healthdirect page on hyperglycaemia.",
      "sub_heading_4":"What should I do if I run out of insulin?",
      "sub_heading_4_description":"It is a good idea to always keep at least one spare vial of insulin for emergencies, and to take your insulin with you when you go out.\n\nIf you run out of insulin:\n\nContact your doctor or diabetes nurse or educator for advice.\nAsk your pharmacist if they can give you an emergency supply (they may charge for this service).",

      "sub_topic_1_description":"Insulin is a hormone that is produced by your body to break down glucose (sugar) from the food you eat, so it can be used for energy.\nIf you have diabetes, your body can\u2019t produce enough insulin, or use it effectively, to break down the glucose in your body and turn it into energy.\nAll people with type 1 diabetes and some people with type 2 diabetes need regular insulin replacement to keep their blood glucose (blood sugar) level under control.\nInsulin needs to be stored and used correctly to be safe and effective.\nTaking too little or too much insulin can make you unwell, so it\u2019s important to take it exactly as instructed by your doctor or diabetes nurse educator.",
      "sub_topic_2":"What types of insulin are available?",
      "sub_topic_2_description":"There are many different types of insulin available:\n\nFast-acting insulin starts to work in 1 \u2013 20 minutes. Its effect peaks at about 1 hour after the injection and lasts for 3 \u2013 5 hours. It\u2019s important to eat right away after injecting fast-acting insulin to avoid hypoglycaemia.\nShort-acting insulin starts to work in about 30 minutes. Its effect peaks at 2 \u2013 4 hours after the injection and lasts for 6 \u2013 8 hours.\nIntermediate-acting insulin starts to work about an hour and a half after you inject it. Its effect peaks at about 4 \u2013 12 hours and lasts for 16 \u2013 24 hours.\nLong-acting insulin works for about 24 hours at a steady dose (with no peak).\nFast- and short-acting (bolus) insulins are taken with meals to allow your body to absorb the glucose (sugar) from your food. Longer acting (bolus) insulins are usually taken daily. They last all day, supplying the \u2018background\u2019 insulin your body needs to maintain a normal blood glucose level.\n\nCombination injections of short- and long-acting insulin are also available.\n\nDepending on the type of insulin and delivery device you use, you will probably need to inject insulin a few times a day.\n\nYour doctor or diabetes nurse educator will discuss your medical situation and lifestyle. They will recommend the best insulin regimen and delivery device for you.",
      "sub_topic_3":"How do I store insulin correctly?",
      "sub_topic_3_description":"Insulin must be stored correctly to work properly. It can be kept at room temperature (below 250 Celsius) for a maximum of one month. Spare insulin should always be kept in the fridge. Never put insulin in the freezer.",
      "sub_topic_4":"What should I do if my insulin is expired?",
      "sub_topic_4_description":"All insulin has an expiry date printed on the packet. If this date has passed, the insulin is expired and should not be used. Instead, it should be returned to the pharmacy for safe disposal.\n\nIf you have noticed your insulin is expired and you don\u2019t have any spare insulin to use, see if you run out of insulin, above.",

Then dial in your correct dose and inject. This ensures the needle is working before use and that no air bubbles are injected into your skin.\nTo avoid medicine leakage, pinch your skin, inject the needle and then slowly remove the needle at the same angle at which you put it in. Press on the injection site for a few seconds to stop any insulin leaking out.\nIf any medicine leaks or spills when you are using your pen, do not take another dose. Monitor your blood sugar level until your next dose is due, then continue to take your medicine as normal.\nRemove the needle from the pen immediately after use and safely dispose of in a sharps bin.\nNever inject through clothing \u2014 this can cause soreness and infection.

You cannot accurately judge your blood sugar level just by how you feel.\n\nNot all people with diabetes need to self-monitor blood glucose. Mostly it is for patients using insulin or if you have gestational diabetes. Your doctor or diabetes nurse educator will advise whether you need to self-monitor your blood glucose levels.\n\nYou can check your blood sugar level using the following equipment:\n\nBlood glucose meter\u2014 a finger-prick device is used to draw a drop of blood from your finger, which you put on a special stick. You then use the meter to see how much glucose is in your blood.\nFlash glucose monitoring\u2014 this system uses sensor technology to test glucose levels, without needing to prick a finger. A sensor worn on the back of the arm connects to a reader or mobile phone application, which stores your glucose levels day and night.\nContinuous glucose monitoring device (CGM)\u2014 a sensor is placed under the skin, which measures your glucose levels 24 hours a day. CGM is useful for people who need close monitoring of their blood glucose levels. The full cost, including consumables (sensors), is around $5,000 per year for people who are not eligible for a National Diabetes Services Scheme (NDSS) subsidy.\nMany blood glucose monitoring products are subsidised by the NDSS, including needles, syringes, blood glucose monitoring strips, urine monitoring strips and insulin pump consumables.

The sensor reads the level of glucose  \n\nin between the cells just underneath the skin. and The sensor needs to be scanned with a reader or smart phone application (app) to display the result. The sensor reads glucose levels every 5 minutes and retains 8 hours of readings which can be downloaded to give you and your diabetes team more insight into your blood glucose management. Flash GM can now be set to alarm when glucose levels are outside your target range. It is important to know that Flash GMs do not measure\u202fblood\u202fglucose levels so you will still need to do finger prick checks in certain circumstances. This is because Flash GM readings lag behind blood glucose readings by 5-10 minutes. \n\nContinuous Glucose Monitors (CGM) \nA CGM is a device which reads the level of glucose in between the cells just underneath the skin\u202fcontinuously. The device consists of a sensor and a transmitter. The sensor is replaced every 1-2 weeks and reattached to the reusable transmitter device. The continuous glucose reading can be sent to a receiver, smart phone app or insulin pump. CGMs can be set to produce audible alarms when glucose levels are outside of the healthy range, for example overnight. It is important to know that CGMs may  require calibration with twice daily blood glucose meter readings because CGM readings lag behind blood glucose readings by 5-10 minutes. ",

And since kids spend nearly half their waking hours in school, reliable diabetes care during the school day really matters.\n\nSome older students will be comfortable testing their blood sugar, injecting insulin, and adjusting levels if they use an insulin pump. Younger students and those who just found out they have diabetes will need help with everyday diabetes care.\n\nIn a perfect world, all teachers and other school staff would understand how to manage diabetes so they could support your child as needed.

Then visit the school and review the DMMP with the principal, office secretary, school nurse, nutrition service manager, teachers, and other staff who may have responsibility for your son or daughter during the day and after school.\n\nThe DMMP explains everything about diabetes management and treatment, including:\n\nTarget blood sugar range and whether your child needs help checking his or her blood sugar\nYour child\u2019s specific low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) symptoms (see the list on this page) and how to treat low blood sugar\nInsulin or other medication used\nMeal and snack plans, including for special events\nHow to manage physical activity/sports\nThe DMMP works with your child\u2019s daily needs and routine. Make sure to update it every year or more often if treatment changes.\n\nYou may want to work with the school to set up a 504 plan that explains what the school will do to make sure your son or daughter is safe and has the same education opportunities as other students. The 504 plan makes the school\u2019s responsibilities clear and helps avoid misunderstandings. A new plan should be set up each school year.\n",

One or more backup school employees should be trained in diabetes care tasks and should be on site at all times during the day, including after-school activities. The 504 plan explains how this works.\n\nMake sure to visit the classroom(s). Some teachers may have had kids with diabetes in class before, but there\u2019s still a learning curve because every student is unique\u2014and so is every teacher.\n\nThis is a great time to talk about class rules. Are students allowed to leave the room without asking? Should they raise their hand? The more your child and teacher understand each other\u2019s needs, the less disruptive and awkward self-care activities will be. You may want to ask if the teacher could talk to the class about diabetes\u2014what it is and isn\u2019t, what happens, and what needs to be done every day\u2014without pointing out that your child has diabetes.\n\nAlso let the teacher know specific signs to look for if your son or daughter\u2019s blood sugar is too low. Does he or she get irritable or nervous? Hungry or dizzy? The teacher may notice the signs before your child does and can alert him or her to eat an appropriate snack or get help.\n\nCheck in with nutrition services (school cafeteria) to get menus and nutritional information to help your child plan insulin use. Some students bring lunch from home because it\u2019s easier to stick to their meal plan.\n\nKids with diabetes need to be physically active just like other kids. In fact, physical activity can help them use less insulin because it lowers blood sugar. Talk with the physical education instructor about what your kid needs to participate fully and safely.\n\nAnd as the school year gets into full swing, get familiar with the daily school schedule, including any after-school activities. You\u2019ll want to know where and when you can find your child if needed. Some parents use a free smartphone app to help them stay informed and in touch with their child.",

      "sub_topic_1_description":"Diabetes is a chronic, metabolic disease characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose (or blood sugar), which leads over time to serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves. The most common is type 2 diabetes, usually in adults, which occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't make enough insulin. In the past 3 decades the prevalence of type 2 diabetes has risen dramatically in countries of all income levels. Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin by itself. For people living with diabetes, access to affordable treatment, including insulin, is critical to their survival. There is a globally agreed target to halt the rise in diabetes and obesity by 2025. \n\nAbout 422 million people worldwide have diabetes, the majority living in low-and middle-income countries, and 1.5 million deaths are directly attributed to diabetes each year. Both the number of cases and the prevalence of diabetes have been steadily increasing over the past few decades. ",

These include policies and practices across whole populations and within specific settings (school, home, workplace) that contribute to good health for everyone, regardless of whether they have diabetes, such as exercising regularly, eating healthily, avoiding smoking, and controlling blood pressure and lipids. \n\nThe starting point for living well with diabetes is an early diagnosis \u2013 the longer a person lives with undiagnosed and untreated diabetes, the worse their health outcomes are likely to be. Easy access to basic diagnostics, such as blood glucose testing, should therefore be available in primary health care settings. Patients will need periodic specialist assessment or treatment for complications. \n\nA series of cost-effective interventions can improve patient outcomes, regardless of what type of diabetes they may have. These interventions include blood glucose control through a combination of diet, physical activity and, if necessary, medication; control of blood pressure and lipids to reduce cardiovascular risk and other complications; and regular screening for damage to the eyes, kidneys and feet to facilitate early treatment.

      "sub_heading_7":"What else can cause diabetes?",
      "sub_heading_7_description":"Genetic mutations, other diseases, damage to the pancreas, and certain medicines may also cause diabetes.\n\nGenetic mutations\nMonogenic diabetes is caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene. These changes are usually passed through families, but sometimes the gene mutation happens on its own. Most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by making the pancreas less able to make insulin. The most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Neonatal diabetes occurs in the first 6 months of life. Doctors usually diagnose MODY during adolescence or early adulthood, but sometimes the disease is not diagnosed until later in life.\nCystic fibrosis NIH external link produces thick mucus that causes scarring in the pancreas. This scarring can prevent the pancreas from making enough insulin.\nHemochromatosis causes the body to store too much iron. If the disease is not treated, iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs.\nHormonal diseases\nSome hormonal diseases cause the body to produce too much of certain hormones, which sometimes cause insulin resistance and diabetes.\n\nCushing\u2019s syndrome occurs when the body produces too much cortisol\u2014often called the \u201cstress hormone.\u201d\nAcromegaly occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone.\nHyperthyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone.\nDamage to or removal of the pancreas\nPancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, and trauma can all harm the beta cells or make them less able to produce insulin, resulting in diabetes. If the damaged pancreas is removed, diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells.\n\nMedicines\nSometimes certain medicines can harm beta cells or disrupt the way insulin works. These include\n\nniacin, a type of vitamin B3\ncertain types of diuretics, also called water pills\nanti-seizure drugs\npsychiatric drugs\ndrugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV NIH external link)\npentamidine, a drug used to treat a type of pneumonia External link\nglucocorticoids\u2014medicines used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis NIH external link, asthma NIH external link, lupus NIH external link, and ulcerative colitis\nanti-rejection medicines, used to help stop the body from rejecting a transplanted organ\nStatins, which are medicines to reduce LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol levels, can slightly increase the chance that you\u2019ll develop diabetes. However, statins help protect you from heart disease and stroke. For this reason, the strong benefits of taking statins outweigh the small chance that you could develop diabetes.\n\nIf you take any of these medicines and are concerned about their side effects, talk with your doctor.",

Health care professionals most often use the random plasma glucose (RPG) test to diagnose type 1 diabetes. This blood test measures your blood glucose level at a single point in time. Sometimes health professionals also use the A1C blood test to find out how long someone has had high blood glucose.\n\nEven though these tests can confirm that you have diabetes, they can\u2019t identify what type you have. Treatment depends on the type of diabetes, so knowing whether you have type 1 or type 2 is important.\n\nTo find out if your diabetes is type 1, your health care professional may test your blood for certain autoantibodies. Autoantibodies are antibodies that attack your healthy tissues and cells by mistake. The presence of certain types of autoantibodies is common in type 1 but not in type 2 diabetes.\n\nBecause type 1 diabetes can run in families, your health care professional can test your family members for autoantibodies. Type 1 diabetes TrialNet, an international research network, also offers autoantibody testing to family members External link of people diagnosed with the disease. The presence of autoantibodies, even without diabetes symptoms, means the family member is more likely to develop type 1 diabetes. If you have a brother or sister, child, or parent with type 1 diabetes, you may want to get an autoantibody test.

Common options include a needle and syringe, insulin pen, or insulin pump.\n\nSome people who have trouble reaching their blood glucose targets with insulin alone also might need to take another type of diabetes medicine that works with insulin, such as pramlintide NIH external link. Pramlintide, given by injection, helps keep blood glucose levels from going too high after eating. Few people with type 1 diabetes take pramlintide, however. The NIH has recently funded a large research study to test use of pramlintide along with insulin and glucagon in people with type 1 diabetes.

      "sub_topic_4_description":"The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has played an important role in developing \u201cartificial pancreas\u201d technology. An artificial pancreas replaces manual blood glucose testing and the use of insulin shots. A single system monitors blood glucose levels around the clock and provides insulin or a combination of insulin and glucagon automatically. The system can also be monitored remotely, for example by parents or medical staff.\n\nIn 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a type of artificial pancreas system called a hybrid closed-loop system. This system tests your glucose level every 5 minutes throughout the day and night through a continuous glucose monitor, and automatically gives you the right amount of basal insulin, a long-acting insulin, through a separate insulin pump. You still need to manually adjust the amount of insulin the pump delivers at mealtimes and when you need a correction dose. You also will need to test your blood with a glucose meter several times a day. Talk with your health care provider about whether this system might be right for you.\n\nThe continuous glucose monitor sends information through a software program called a control algorithm. Based on your glucose level, the algorithm tells the insulin pump how much insulin to deliver. The software program could be installed on the pump or another device such as a cell phone or computer.\n\nStarting in late 2016 and early 2017, the NIDDK has funded several important studies NIH external link on different types of artificial pancreas devices to better help people with type 1 diabetes manage their disease. The devices may also help people with type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes.\n\nNIDDK is also supporting research into pancreatic islet transplantation\u2014an experimental treatment for hard-to-control type 1 diabetes. Pancreatic islets are clusters of cells in the pancreas that make insulin. Type 1 diabetes attacks these cells. A pancreatic islet transplant replaces destroyed islets with new ones that make and release insulin. This procedure takes islets from the pancreas of an organ donor and transfers them to a person with type 1 diabetes. Because researchers are still studying pancreatic islet transplantation, the procedure is only available to people enrolled in a study. Learn more about islet transplantation studies ",

Genetic testing is done by specialized labs.\n\nAbnormal results can determine the gene responsible for diabetes in a particular individual or show whether someone is likely to develop a monogenic form of diabetes in the future. Genetic testing can be helpful in selecting the most appropriate treatment for individuals with monogenic diabetes. Testing is also important in planning for pregnancy and to understand the risk of having a child with monogenic diabetes if you, your partner, or your family members have monogenic diabetes.\n\nMost forms of NDM and MODY are caused by autosomal dominant NIH external link mutations, meaning that the condition can be passed on to children when only one parent carries or has the disease gene. With dominant mutations, a parent who carries the gene has a 50 percent chance of having an affected child with monogenic diabetes.\n\nIn contrast, with autosomal recessive NIH disease, a mutation must be inherited from both parents. In this instance, a child has a 25 percent chance of having monogenic diabetes.\n\nFor recessive forms of monogenic diabetes, testing can indicate whether parents or siblings without disease are carriers for recessive genetic conditions that could be inherited by their children.\n\nWhile not as common, it is possible to inherit mutations from the mother only (X-linked mutations). Also not as common are mutations that occur spontaneously.\n\nMore information about the genes that cause NDM and MODY, the types of mutations responsible for the disease (autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked, etc.), and clinical features is provided in the American Diabetes Association Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes External link.\n\nIf you suspect that you or a member of your family may have a monogenic form of diabetes, you should seek help from health care professionals\u2014physicians and genetic counselors\u2014who have specialized knowledge and experience in this area. They can determine whether genetic testing is appropriate; select the genetic tests that should be performed; and provide information about the basic principles of genetics, genetic testing options, and confidentiality issues.

In the United States, monogenic forms of diabetes account for about 1 to 4 percent of all cases of diabetes.1,2,3,4 In most cases of monogenic diabetes, the gene mutation is inherited from one or both parents. Sometimes the gene mutation develops spontaneously, meaning that the mutation is not carried by either of the parents. Most mutations that cause monogenic diabetes reduce the body\u2019s ability to produce insulin, a protein produced in the pancreas that helps the body use glucose for energy.\n\nNeonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) are the two main forms of monogenic diabetes. NDM occurs in newborns and young infants. MODY is much more common than NDM and usually first occurs in adolescence or early adulthood.\n\nMost cases of monogenic diabetes are incorrectly diagnosed. For example, when high blood glucose is first detected in adulthood, type 2 diabetes is often diagnosed instead of monogenic diabetes. If your health care provider thinks you might have monogenic diabetes, genetic testing may be needed to diagnose it and to identify which type. Testing of other family members may also be indicated to determine whether they are at risk for or already have a monogenic form of diabetes that is passed down from generation to generation.

NDM is a rare condition accounting for up to 1 in 400,000 infants in the United States.4 Infants with NDM do not produce enough insulin, leading to an increase in blood glucose. NDM is often mistaken for type 1 diabetes, but type 1 diabetes is very rarely seen before 6 months of age. Diabetes that occurs in the first 6 months of life almost always has a genetic cause. Researchers have identified a number of specific genes and mutations that can cause NDM. In about half of those with NDM, the condition is lifelong and is called permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM). In the rest of those with NDM, the condition is transient, or temporary, and disappears during infancy but can reappear later in life. This type of NDM is called transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM).\n\nClinical features of NDM depend on the gene mutations a person has. Signs of NDM include frequent urination, rapid breathing, and dehydration.5 NDM can be diagnosed by finding elevated levels of glucose in blood or urine. The lack of insulin may cause the body to produce chemicals called ketones, resulting in a potentially life-threatening condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. Most fetuses with NDM do not grow well in the womb, and newborns with NDM are much smaller than those of the same gestational age, a condition called intrauterine growth restriction. After birth, some infants fail to gain weight and grow as rapidly as other infants of the same age and sex. Appropriate therapy may improve and normalize growth and development.",

This leads to high blood glucose levels and, in time, may damage body tissues, particularly the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and blood vessels.\n\nClinical features of MODY depend on the gene mutations a person has. People with certain types of mutations may have slightly high blood sugar levels that remain stable throughout life, have mild or no symptoms of diabetes, and do not develop any long-term complications. Their high blood glucose levels may only be discovered during routine blood tests. However, other mutations require specific treatment with either insulin or a type of oral diabetes medication called sulfonylureas.\n\nMODY may be confused with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. In the past, people with MODY did not generally have overweight, obesity, or other risk factors for type 2 diabetes, such as high blood pressure or abnormal blood fat levels. However, as more people in the United States become overweight or have obesity, people with MODY may also be overweight or have obesity.\n\nAlthough both type 2 diabetes and MODY can run in families, people with MODY typically have a family history of diabetes in multiple successive generations, meaning MODY is present in a grandparent, a parent, and a child.",

Those with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are finding that their body either resists the effects of the insulin they are producing or that they merely do not produce enough insulin to maintain proper levels of blood glucose.\n\nSymptoms of type 2 usually develop slowly over time and someone with T2D might not know for years that they have the disease. Still, it is incredibly important to be on the lookout for symptoms that might be indicating a serious issue is on the rise.

Sugar not making its way to cells in the body causes an overall depletion of energy, often times leading to intense hunger, but also resulting in weight loss that cannot be explained.\n\nBlurred vision \u2013 when blood sugar reaches a high point, fluid fails to make its way to the eye lenses, which then affects one\u2019s ability to have focused vision.\n\nFatigue \u2013 excessive tiredness and irritability results from blood glucose deprivation in one\u2019s cells and can be a crucial, yet easy to overlook warning sign.\n\nFrequent infections and slow-healing sores \u2013 a repeated resistance to infections, especially feminine ones like yeast infections and noticing a sudden slowness to healing can also be attributed to type 2 diabetes.\n\nAreas of darkened skin \u2013 folds of the skins, such as the neck, armpit and groin may appear darker than normal as a result of insulin resistance. The term for this is acanthosis nigricans.\n\nFoot pain and numbness \u2013 pain, tingling and loss of feeling in hands and feet are signs of potential neuropathy, a common symptom of type 2.\n\nHeadaches \u2013 these are a common symptom of both high and low blood glucose, signifying that blood sugar is potentially out of its target range.\n\nType 2 diabetes can increase chances of heart disease.

      "description":"We\u2019ve all heard it before\u2014it\u2019s important to test our blood sugar to manage type 2 diabetes. That makes sense, right? We need to know our blood glucose numbers in order to make the necessary adjustments to our diet, exercise routine, and identify any other stressors that impact them. Also, research suggests self-monitoring of blood glucose improves glycemic control, particularly in people with type 2 diabetes who aren\u2019t treated with insulin. This improved control lowers the risk of diabetes-related complications. And, after all, you can get a reading on your blood glucose meter in just a few minutes. ",

      "sub_topic_1":"Why is there anxiety around blood sugar testing?",
      "sub_topic_1_description":"We decided to ask the people who can tell us best: people with type 2 diabetes, themselves. In a post about blood testing anxiety and stress on the Beyond Type 2 Instagram and Facebook page, members of our community responded with a number of reasons why they\u2019re anxious checking blood sugar. One member said she has \u201cthe worst anxiety pushing the button on her lancet.\u201d The fear of lancet needles, which can be a result of needle phobia, the pain associated with testing and the fear of drawing blood are associated with worse glycemic control, especially among patients who are on insulin who are instructed to test regularly. \n\nAnother said that they\u2019re hesitant to test their blood sugar if they know they\u2019ve eaten something that will make their numbers high. Sometimes just knowing the potential meter reading can cause stress and anxiety, commented another Beyond Type 2 follower. William Polonsky, PhD., CDE, once wrote blood glucose monitoring can serve as a reminder diabetes is always there, which is stressful. \n\nNot all anxiety comes from the fear of needles or worries about the reading on the meter. The financial implications play a role, too. Test strips and lancets are costly. If you\u2019re a person who needs or wants to check your blood sugar frequently, worries about replenishing your lancet and strip supplies can keep you from doing it. \n\nDiabetes can be unpredictable. Sometimes, we can give our best efforts to stick to a routine and diabetes still \u201cdoes what it wants.\u201d One reader described, \u201cI can do the same exact thing every single day and get a different reading. But at the same time, I know I\u2019m taking care of myself by testing.\u201d \n\nAnd our loved ones? While they want what\u2019s best for us, it can be bothersome if they get a peek at our numbers and ask questions about our diabetes care we\u2019d rather not answer or give unsolicited advice about our lifestyle.",
      "sub_topic_2":"5 Ways to overcome blood sugar test anxiety",
      "sub_topic_2_description":"Fortunately, anxiety can be overcome by thinking about testing your blood sugar differently and the readings your meter displays. Here are five tips to consider: \n\nIt\u2019s Just a Number\n\nUnderstand there are no \u201cgood or bad\u201d blood sugar numbers. We know\u2014it\u2019s hard to reconcile with this concept. People with diabetes are often commended when their readings are \u201cgood\u201d and reprimanded when they\u2019re \u201cbad.\u201d But your readings are just a number \u2014 a data point to help you determine how you should adjust your routine. As one commenter on our social media posts put it, \u201cI reframe it as it is what it is. It is a purely educational tool and behavior modification.\u201d \n\nAsk for Help, but Set Boundaries \n\nIf you\u2019re struggling with checking your blood sugar, ask a loved one to help you. For example, one of our readers overcame her anxiety by having her significant other push her finger on the lancet to help her get used to the feeling of testing on her own. However, while you\u2019re asking for help, be sure to make it known you\u2019re in charge of your diabetes, no matter the result displayed on your meter.\n\nConsider a Diabetes Supplies Subscription Service\n\nSubscription services can help you save money than buying them directly from the pharmacy. Companies, such as Accu-Chek, offer products such as meters and test strips, in which customers can buy a bundle and have them delivered to their homes each month. \n\nTry New Equipment\n\nAre you using the monitoring devices that are right for you? William Polonsky recommends changing lancets or adjusting the depth of penetration if your fingers are bruising or if testing is too painful. \n\nFind Peer Support\n\nThere are plenty of people with diabetes online and in-person who can relate to your experiences. Reach out to individuals who may have tips for reducing the anxiety and stress of blood glucose testing. ",

Hyperglycemia can occur when your body is under physical stress, like when you\u2019re fighting an infection or other illness if you\u2019re recovering from an injury, or recently had surgery. Emotional stress also contributes to hyperglycemia as hormones produced in response to stress cause blood glucose levels to rise.

When we eat, our bodies break down complex carbohydrates into glucose, the fuel we need. The pancreas releases insulin that acts as a kind of key to unlock the cells, allowing glucose to enter and be absorbed. In type 2,  the pancreas initially produces extra insulin, but eventually cannot keep up with production in order to keep blood sugar levels in check.

Lifestyle factors such as a poor high-calorie diet of processed and junk foods, obesity, high blood pressure, physical inactivity and genetics are commonly linked to a diabetes diagnosis. However, it\u2019s important to know type 2 diabetes is not limited to people who are obese or eat an unhealthy diet. It can affect people of all sizes and backgrounds.\n",
      "sub_topic_2":"THE RISKS OF HAVING TYPE 2 DIABETES",
      "sub_topic_2_description":"Having type 2 diabetes also greatly increases your risks for other health problems. Think of high blood sugar as a honey-like substance in your bloodstream, preventing blood from flowing properly to your organs, eyes, brain, feet and heart. If those parts of your body can\u2019t receive the right amount of circulation to function, can you guess what happens?\n\nThat\u2019s right\u2014complications. Serious ones that can cause long term damage or be fatal.\n\nT2D increases your risks of having a  stroke, heart attack, blindness, neuropathy (nerve damage), heart disease, falling into a coma and hypertension.",
      "sub_topic_3":"WHAT CAN I DO TODAY TO DECREASE THE RISKS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES COMPLICATIONS?",
      "sub_topic_3_description":"You can get started on the path to controlled diabetes today! Here are some easy quick tips to help you:\n\nTest your blood sugar and consult your doctor about your target blood sugar levels. Set appointments to see any other health specialists you need to see such as an eye doctor, podiatrist, nutritionist and diabetes educator.\nDownload an app to track which foods you\u2019re eating and note how they affect your blood sugar levels. There are also apps that can help you track your blood sugar.\nMake a list of foods you love. Determine which ones you may need to consume less or more of.\nMake a healthy meal at home\u2014preferably one of your favorites. The goal is to begin the habit of cooking at home, which can help you control how much fat, carbs and sodium you consume.\nGo to the grocery store. Buy an assortment of fruits, vegetables, whole-grains, meats and seafood. Don\u2019t forget your favorite seasonings, herbs and other flavor boosters! Buy things you like instead of foods you think you should like.\nGet moving. You don\u2019t need an expensive gym membership to workout. Going for a walk is free. If you\u2019re new to exercise, start with five minutes a day, set a manageable goal, stick with it and build from there. Who knows? The following week, you may be walking 10 minutes per day.\nUnderstand your health insurance coverage. You can call your health insurance company and ask them which medications and supplies are covered and their out-of-pocket costs. If they\u2019re too expensive, ask about the costs of generic versions. If the costs are still too high, contact local health clinics in your area and ask them about their diabetes-care services. If you don\u2019t have health coverage, contact your state health exchange and ask if you\u2019re eligible for financial assistance.\nType 2 diabetes is a serious disease. It\u2019s silent and you can\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d it until you experience some of the symptoms or a complication. With that said, living a full life with type 2 diabetes is possible if managed properly, and you don\u2019t need to go on a restrictive diet to enjoy food or exercise several hours a day to manage your blood sugar. Also, this illness isn\u2019t one-size-fits-all, so the way diabetes affects you won\u2019t be the same way it affects another. Most importantly, there is no shame in having type 2 diabetes and it doesn\u2019t imply you\u2019re a failure at life. At Beyond Type 2, our motto is You Are Not Alone. There are millions who live well with it and are willing to support you, including this community. Our mission is to provide the resources and community to ensure you can live a healthy life on your terms and Beyond Type 2 diabetes.\n",

Pupils are the black circles in the middle of your eyes. The drops are painless and help your eye doctor see inside your eyes to look for signs of health problems.\nA dilated eye exam can help your eye doctor find and treat problems to keep you from losing your vision from diabetes.\nYour eye doctor may take pictures of your eyes with a tool called retinal photography. This tool helps the doctor see your retina, which is at the back part of your eyes.\nBe sure to make and keep your next eye doctor appointment!\nVisit your eye doctor right away if you:\n\nSee little black lines or spots that don\u2019t go away.\nSee any red spots or a red fog.\nHave a sudden change in how clearly you see.\nTake longer than usual to adjust to darkness.\nTalk with all of your health care providers about ways to manage your diabetes.\n\nAsk your health care team to help you set and reach goals to manage your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol.\nGet regular A1C tests to measure your blood sugar over time because poor blood sugar can make eye problems happen faster.\nAsk about safe ways to be more active each day and foods that are healthy to eat.",

The Tips campaign features real people who are living with serious health conditions caused by smoking and secondhand smoke exposure. The newest Tips series adds compelling stories from family members who take care of loved ones affected by a smoking-related disease or disability.\n\nTips connects people who smoke with resources to help them quit, including 1-800-QUIT-NOW, which directs people to free services from their state quitlines.\n\n\u2217When CDC references tobacco on this web page, we are referring to the use of commercial tobacco and not the sacred and traditional use of tobacco by some American Indian communities.\n",

DSMES has been shown to reduce A1C levels (average blood sugar over the last 2 to 3 months), reduce the onset and severity of diabetes complications, improve quality of life, and lower health care costs.\n\nPeople who live in rural areas have higher rates of diabetes compared to people who live in urban areas, but 62% of rural counties have limited DSMES services. Using telehealth (delivery by phone, Internet, or videoconference) allows more patients in rural areas to benefit from DSMES. CDC funds state and local health departments to improve access to, participation in, and health benefit coverage for DSMES, with emphasis on programs that achieve Association of Diabetes Care & Education Specialists accreditation or American Diabetes Association recognition. These programs meet national quality standards and may be more sustainable because of reimbursement eligibility.",

The CDC-led National Diabetes Prevention Program (National DPP) is a public-private partnership working to build a nationwide system to deliver an affordable, evidence-based lifestyle change program proven to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes. Participants in the program learn to make healthy food choices, be more physically active, and find ways to cope with problems and stress. These lifestyle changes can cut their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by as much as 58% (71% for those 60 or older).\n\nIn April 2018, the lifestyle change program became a covered service for Medicare beneficiaries with prediabetes. This is the first preventive service model from the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation that has been expanded into the Medicare program\u2014a landmark for public health.\n\nCDC funds all 50 states, the District of Columbia, national organizations, and several large city health departments to:\n\nImprove awareness of prediabetes among health care providers and people at risk.\nIncrease access to and enrollment in the National DPP lifestyle change program.\nIncrease coverage for the lifestyle change program among public and private payers and employers.\nImprove screening and testing for prediabetes and refer people who are eligible to the lifestyle change program.\nIn partnership with the American Medical Association and the Ad Council, CDC leads the award-winning Do I Have Prediabetes? campaign.

      "sub_topic_2_description":"The retina is the light-sensitive layer of cells at the back of the eye that converts light into electrical signals. The signals are sent to the brain and the brain turns them into the images you see.\n\nThe retina needs a constant supply of blood, which it receives through a network of tiny blood vessels. Over time, a persistently high blood sugar level can damage these blood vessels in three main stages:\n\ntiny bulges develop in the blood vessels, which may bleed slightly but don\u2019t usually affect your vision \u2013 this is known as background retinopathy\nmore severe and widespread changes affect the blood vessels, including more significant bleeding into the eye \u2013 this is known as pre-proliferative retinopathy\nscar tissue and new blood vessels, which are weak and bleed easily, develop on the retina \u2013 this is known as proliferative retinopathy and it can result in some loss of vision\nHowever, if a problem with your eyes is picked up early, lifestyle changes and/or treatment can stop it getting worse.",

This can lead to a serious short-term condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. This is when the bloodstream becomes acidic, you develop dangerous levels of ketones in your blood stream and become severely dehydrated.\n\nThis results in the body being unable to produce insulin, which is required to move glucose out of the blood and into your cells to be used for energy. This is called Type 1 diabetes.",
      "sub_heading_2":"Treating type 1 diabetes",
      "sub_heading_2_description":"It\u2019s important that diabetes is diagnosed as early as possible. If left untreated, type-1 diabetes is a life-threatening condition. It\u2019s essential that treatment is started early.\n\nDiabetes can\u2019t be cured, but treatment aims to keep your blood glucose levels as normal as possible and control your symptoms, to prevent health problems developing later in life.\n\nIf you\u2019re diagnosed with diabetes, you\u2019ll be referred to a diabetes care team for specialist treatment and monitoring.\n\nAs your body can\u2019t produce insulin, you\u2019ll need regular insulin injections to keep your glucose levels normal. You\u2019ll be taught how to do this and how to match the insulin you inject to the food (carbohydrate) you eat, taking into account your blood glucose level and how much exercise you do.\n\nInsulin injections come in several different forms, with each working slightly differently. You\u2019ll most likely need a combination of different insulin preparations.\n\nInsulin is given to some patients by a continuous infusion of fast (rapid) acting insulin (pump therapy). This is where a small device constantly pumps insulin (at a rate you control) into your bloodstream through a plastic tube (cannula) that\u2019s inserted under the skin with a needle.\n\nThere are alternatives to insulin injections and pumps, but they\u2019re only suitable for a small number of patients. They are:\n\nislet cell transplantation \u2013 where healthy insulin-producing cells from the pancreas of a deceased donor are implanted into the pancreas of someone with type 1 diabetes\na complete pancreas transplant \u2013 this is still relatively rare and only a few centres of excellence offer this.",
      "sub_heading_3":"Complications",
      "sub_heading_3_description":"If diabetes is left untreated, it can cause a number of different health problems. Large amounts of glucose can damage blood vessels, nerves and organs.\n\nHaving a consistently raised glucose level that doesn\u2019t cause any symptoms can have damaging effects in the long term.\n\nThere is also complications that can arise if your insulin is not balanced with your food intake and exercise. Your diabetes team will work with you to manage your insulin correctly.",
      "sub_heading_4":"Living with diabetes",

Stopping smoking (if you smoke) will also reduce your risk of developing cardiovascular disease.\n\nYour healthcare team will discuss this with you, and you can see your own results through My Diabetes My Way. It\u2019s important that you learn the skills to self manage your diabetes and there are people to help and support you to do this.\n\nIf you have diabetes, your eyes are at risk from diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to sight loss if it\u2019s not treated.

This will allow you to get a new source of insulin.\n\nPancreas transplants are complicated operations and, like other types of major surgery, there\u2019s a risk of complications. In the UK, about 200 pancreas transplants are carried out each year, with more than 300 people on the waiting list.\n\nThe waiting time for a pancreas transplant is one to two years, because there\u2019s a shortage of suitable donor organs.\n",

Your diabetes care team can advise you about the best way to do this.\n\nIf hyperglycaemia isn\u2019t treated, it can lead to a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis, where the body begins to break down fats for energy instead of glucose, resulting in a build-up of ketones (acids) in your blood.\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis is very serious and, if not addressed quickly, it can lead to unconsciousness and, eventually, death.\n\nThe signs of diabetic ketoacidosis include:\n\nfrequently passing urine\nthirst\ntiredness and lethargy (lack of energy)\nblurry vision\nabdominal (stomach) pain\nnausea and vomiting\ndeep breathing\nsmell of ketones on breath (described as smelling like pear drops)\ncollapse and unconsciousness\nRead more about the symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis\n\nYour healthcare team will educate you on how to decrease your risk of ketoacidosis by testing your own blood for ketones using blood ketone sticks if you\u2019re unwell.\n\nIf you develop diabetic ketoacidosis, you\u2019ll need urgent hospital treatment.

This prevents light fully passing through to your retina. If it isn\u2019t treated, it can damage your vision.\n\nAnnual eye checks are usually organised by a regional photographic unit. If significant damage is detected, you may be referred to a doctor who specialises in treating eye conditions (ophthalmologist) such as cataract and glaucoma.\n\nThe better you control your blood glucose levels, the lower your risk of developing serious eye problems.\n\nTreatment for diabetic retinopathy is only necessary if screening detects significant problems that mean your vision is at risk.\n\nIf the condition hasn\u2019t reached this stage, the advice on managing your diabetes, BP and cholesterol level is recommended.\n\nThe main treatments for more advanced diabetic retinopathy are:\n\nlaser treatment\ninjections of medication into your eyes\nan operation to remove blood or scar tissue from your eyes",

Children have nystagmus (wobbly eyes) and photophobia (extreme sensitivity to light). Poor vision can be present even in small babies, and gradual vision loss can lead to blindness.\nHearing loss: This is usually noticed before the age of 10. The severity of hearing loss in Alstr\u00f6m Syndrome varies considerably.\nCardiomyopathy: This means that the heart doesn\u2019t pump as well as it should. It can improve, although not completely, and it can recur in later life.\nObesity: Children and young people with Alstr\u00f6m Syndrome have a lower energy requirement and generally are less active compared with their peer group; as a result they have a higher risk of obesity. This weight gain tends to be less severe in later life Type 2 diabetes.\nType 2 diabetes: In young adulthood, children with Alstr\u00f6m Syndrome tend to become resistant to insulin, and can go on to develop Type 2 diabetes. High blood fat levels are also common in people with insulin resistance.\nRenal (kidney) failure: This might be acute (happening quickly) or chronic (happening over a long period of time). There are a number of reasons why the kidneys fail; one of these is diabetes.\nOrthopaedic and rheumatology problems: People with Alstr\u00f6m Syndrome can have problems with their bones and joints. These include curvature of the spine, spondylitis (excessive thickening of the spine), arthritis and short stature. Other problems such as hypogonadism (defects of the reproductive system), undescended testes, low testosterone, polycystic ovaries, underactive thyroid and acanthosis nigricans (dark patches of skin) may also be present.\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    Treating Alstr\u00f6m Syndrome\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    There isn\u2019t a cure for Alstr\u00f6m Syndrome, but there are treatments for some of the features: sensitivity to bright light can be helped by wearing dark glasses, which may also slow down retinal degeneration as well. Hearing aids can be helpful in managing hearing loss. A number of drugs can be used to treat cardiomyopathy, including digoxin, frusemide and ACE inhibitors.\n\nFollowing a healthy, balanced, low-energy diet and taking regular physical activity are important to keep weight under control and will usually be the first treatment for Type 2 diabetes.\n\nMedications such as metformin, sulphonylureas and insulin can be used to treat Type 2 diabetes if weight management and physical activity are unsuccessful.\n\nThe treatment for renal (kidney) failure depends on how well the kidneys are working, but dialysis and kidney transplants are available should they fail completely.\n\nPhysical activity, stretching exercises, and massage can help with bone and joint problems.\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    How common is Alstr\u00f6m Syndrome?\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    Alstr\u00f6m Syndrome is very rare, and estimates suggest there are only around 700 people diagnosed with it worldwide. But Alstr\u00f6m UK (the charity for people affected by Alstr\u00f6m Syndrome) estimate that up to 200 families in the UK may be affected, but because of its rarity many have not been identified. Alstr\u00f6m Syndrome can be diagnosed from the features above, but there is also a genetic test that can be done. Scientists have identified a gene that causes Alstr\u00f6m Syndrome which is recessive, which means that the gene must be passed on by both parents.\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    None\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    None\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    None\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    None\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    None\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    None\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    None\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    None\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    None\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    None\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    None\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    None\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    None\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    None\n   </p>\n   <h2>\n    None\n   </h2>\n   <p>\n    None\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It can improve, although not completely, and it can recur in later life.\nObesity: Children and young people with Alstr\u00f6m Syndrome have a lower energy requirement and generally are less active compared with their peer group; as a result they have a higher risk of obesity. This weight gain tends to be less severe in later life Type 2 diabetes.\nType 2 diabetes: In young adulthood, children with Alstr\u00f6m Syndrome tend to become resistant to insulin, and can go on to develop Type 2 diabetes. High blood fat levels are also common in people with insulin resistance.\nRenal (kidney) failure: This might be acute (happening quickly) or chronic (happening over a long period of time). There are a number of reasons why the kidneys fail; one of these is diabetes.\nOrthopaedic and rheumatology problems: People with Alstr\u00f6m Syndrome can have problems with their bones and joints. These include curvature of the spine, spondylitis (excessive thickening of the spine), arthritis and short stature. Other problems such as hypogonadism (defects of the reproductive system), undescended testes, low testosterone, polycystic ovaries, underactive thyroid and acanthosis nigricans (dark patches of skin) may also be present.",

Hearing aids can be helpful in managing hearing loss. A number of drugs can be used to treat cardiomyopathy, including digoxin, frusemide and ACE inhibitors.\n\nFollowing a healthy, balanced, low-energy diet and taking regular physical activity are important to keep weight under control and will usually be the first treatment for Type 2 diabetes.\n\nMedications such as metformin, sulphonylureas and insulin can be used to treat Type 2 diabetes if weight management and physical activity are unsuccessful.\n\nThe treatment for renal (kidney) failure depends on how well the kidneys are working, but dialysis and kidney transplants are available should they fail completely.\n\nPhysical activity, stretching exercises, and massage can help with bone and joint problems.\n",

But Alstr\u00f6m UK (the charity for people affected by Alstr\u00f6m Syndrome) estimate that up to 200 families in the UK may be affected, but because of its rarity many have not been identified. Alstr\u00f6m Syndrome can be diagnosed from the features above, but there is also a genetic test that can be done. Scientists have identified a gene that causes Alstr\u00f6m Syndrome which is recessive, which means that the gene must be passed on by both parents.",

But there are actually many other types of diabetes that aren't as well known. \nType 3c diabetes develops because of the damage to the pancreas, which can happen for a few different reasons. And although it's different to other types, you can get a wrong diagnosis of type 2 because type 3c isn't well known. Type 3c is not a recognised medical condition. \n\nNot getting the right diagnosis can be really difficult to deal with emotionally. You might feel angry at not getting the right treatment or you could just get worn out by the whole process. So make sure you find someone to talk to. Our forum has a lot of threads about type 3c from people who've experienced similar things to you. Being part of a community like that can help get you through difficult times. \n\n",

So you can ask your doctor to check for type 3c if you've had pancreatic problems and explain your reasons why.\n\nIf you have a type 3c diagnosis, you should be seen by a healthcare team that knows what to do.

There isn't a one-size-fits-all treatment because it really comes down to how much damage your pancreas has. And you may benefit from more regular reviews by your healthcare team.\n\nYou\u2019re likely to start on metformin to help manage your blood sugar levels. Metformin works by helping the insulin you produce to work better. This should then reduce your blood sugar levels.\n\nBut if this isn\u2019t enough to manage your blood sugar and you\u2019re losing weight then you\u2019ll move on to insulin. Many people with type 3c diabetes require insulin at an earlier stage compared to people with type 2 diabetes to help manage their blood sugar levels.
